Cruz","Echo ""no"" show?","January 25, 2018","Has potential . I believe with future firmware upgrades will make this device more reliable and usable. I guess for me the main disappoint for me is the fact their is very little video content. That's whole reason behind adding a screen to this device is to be able to view video content. No youtube support and videos they do have are not the best. You do have access to movies if you have prime but that's only if your subscribed to the service. The audio is better but not by much. Don't expect to fill the room with bass because it's not what's it's meant for.  Overall I can't complain too much as I got this device when it was on sale at 149.00,. I think at its normal price of over 200.00 is really overpriced for what it can do.

The digital assistant is truly amazing once you enable the skills necessary for your personal liking.

I do agree with some reviews that the inability to access YouTube and a web browser is disappointing. But that's doesn't take away from the unlimited abilities that the Amazon Echo Show provide.

The skills are unlimited and there being created all the time. No one has all of the answers during  course of their day, family and kids.

The Amazon Echo Show certainly supports a family or personal use in the manner and it's a source of enjoyable entertainment.

The drop in feature is a little intrusive, if you don't want people from your contact list or other Amazon Echo Show owners on your list to drop in without warning. However, your able to turn that feature off.

As with any electronics, do your research online about the unlimited ability of Amazon Echo Show, so that you're able to fully enjoy and understand the intricacies that make this digital assistant a must have in your home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_196?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=196&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was sent an email to review the product but when I sent it, it bounced back saying the product was not out yet. So here was my review:
  Echo Show arrived late afternoon. Played with it all evening and spent the evening having the device read one of the books in my library. I could not figure out how to get news from Los Angeles. The only news it would deliver was NPR from Washington D.C. Was really looking for an update on local fires. I am sure I will figure it out.
  Like the changing background and the notification sound when I speak. Setup was very simple. I am going to setup the second unit in the kitchen. The kitchen has an area with a desk and work area, so this will be a perfect spot for recipes while in the kitchen and music or homework help while at the desk. This is a definite 5 star out of the box.
  It has been a week now, and I love this thing even more. It reads my Audible books, gives me the news, keeps my market list, sets my alarms and so much more. Don't know how I lived without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Have owned Echo devices for several years.  So I was thrilled that a screen has been added.  So far though, I haven't found enough content that utilizes the screen in such a way that it makes this 5 stars.  The ability to video chat with other Echo Show or Alexa App owners is nice, as is watching Amazon content, and I gave it an extra star for those capabilities.  Having some issues with it pulling up my calendar when I ask it to show my calendar.  But if I ask what my next appointment is, the display will show a scroll of my calendar events.  These little quirks will get resolved but it is a little frustrating.  Would also love ability to watch ESPN via a subscription or live morning news while in the kitchen or getting ready in the morning.  Either I haven't figured out how to do that, or it isn't able to  - yet.  And that is why I love the Echo products.  The possibilities are exciting.

I like the Echo Show, however, I think much of its potential remains untapped.  I understand that it's still relatively new, and that much of its potential may lie with third parties building skills for it, but Amazon should strongly encourage companies to build skills specifically for the Show.  For example, Netflix does not currently work with the show.  Neither does Plex.  having these two apps on the Show would instantly mean a 5-star rating from me.  It would also be great if I had some way of reading my email from the show.

I also wish that recipes were easier (since our Show is in the kitchen).  I uploaded all of our personal recipes to allrecipes.com since there is no simple way to have the Show access those locally, but even then, the displayed recipe disappears after a few seconds, and you have to tell the  Show to find it again.  It should stay on the screen until you're done.

I really like the music apps, and the drop-in, telephone, and video-calling functions are wonderful.  With just a few more apps/skills focusing specifically on the video capabilities of the Show, this could be a really great device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Love it. Just one suggestions.  I initially set up and used my Echo show at night. Great. But my house has a lot of glass and light. In the morning, I couldn't see anything on the display unless it was talking and highlighting letters. Even then, they were very dim.  So I asked it to turn up its brightness. It said it didn't know about that, I should check the app. I did. Didn't find anything about it.  I emailed for help and got the answer -- the brightness and other controls are at the top of the screen IF you swipe.  Well, that was great, but it was so dim that I couldn't see the top-of-screen controls, not even in a dim corner of my house, so I had to wait until night time.  Then, when I could swipe and see the controls, I saw that it had arrived set all the way to ""dim.""  Amazon, why not set it at full ""bright,"" or even half-way, so that in daylight, a person can see to adjust it?  Other than that, great.  PS This will be my last-ever review for Amazon. I posted a one-star review on a terrible product from a terribly seller. Amazon took it down. OK, they have that right.  But they also removed the review link from my purchase record, so that I can't post another that they might accept.  I personally consider that to be censorship.

If Amazon were to add their own Youtube type service (since they stream video, why not?), or start selling Google products and fix their relations with Google as to get back this service, I would easily give the Echo Show 5 stars.

Just look up amazon skills and read a few reviews, hardly any of the skills have more than a 2 star rating. Oh, and it won’t run YouTube because that’s owned by google and they have a competing product.

She lives 10 minutes away from me in a senior living community and I spend time with her most days. I got the Echo Show primarily because I love to travel every couple of months but I hate to leave my mom without our regular visits because she always goes into paranoia mode when I'm gone trying to cancel bank accounts (she's very creative about tracking down the bank phone number), etc, etc.. Frankly, I just hate to leave her feeling alone and I'm plagued with guilt.  I love the idea of her being able to see me when I'm gone and to be able to share pictures with her.

Setup was easy but getting this to work was more complicated than I'd planned.  I won't go into the details here but, to sum it up, Amazon had a difficult time changing the phone number on our personal account to mine from my daughter's even though I first changed our business account phone from mine to my husband's.  We're small business owners. I made the changes online but somehow they weren't recognized.  I spoke with Amazon reps a few times and was really disappointed even though I had always felt fantastic with my Amazon interactions before. They kept wanting to transfer me to other departments.  Echo because I couldn't accomplish what I wanted there and Whole Foods because I couldn't go in store and have them pull up my Prime account by my phone number. I finally got an absolutely amazing Amazon rep who, although new, told me she would leave me until she had conquered...and she did!!!  I wish I could tag her in this because she was a hero.

Yesterday I was finally able to figure out the Echo Show.  I video called myself on the Show from my cell phone since I don't personally own any Echo devices.  I downloaded the Amazon Photos app (which I didn't know existed before) and shared photos with the Show.  Suffice it to say that I was really proud of myself.

Then today...brought the Show to my mom along with a simple Alexa command sheet that I'd laminated so she would save it.  Bright pink paper.  She practiced some of the commands like  ""Alexa, what day is it?"" type of stuff and she was thrilled.  She loved the photos that slowly moved across her home screen.  She was absolutely over the moon with the results of ""Alexa, play Perry Como songs."".  (I didn't even know she liked Perry Como!) There were lyrics for some of the songs and she sang along. My heart was smiling and breaking at the same time.

Then...my youngest son ""dropped in"". This required no interaction from my mother.  That would be very hard if she had to figure out how to answer.  He has an Echo but dropped in from his phone so it could be a video call.  She was so happy!!  We're in NC and he is in Boston and she got to see the view from his 11th story apartment and take a ""tour"" of his apartment.  This was priceless beyond words.  Taking her to unfamiliar places causes extreme confusion so I rarely take her anywhere beyond our home base.  She was so thrilled to be able to sit in her recliner and see where my son is.  My daughter in LA dropped in next.  Same priceless reaction.  Now I need NYC son to get the Alexa App.  Mom doesn't have a cell phone anymore because she wasn't using it and a smart phone would be beyond her capabilities.  Now she has all the functionality she needs through the Echo Show.  I'm so, so happy!

I haven't tried this out yet for my original purpose to connect when I travel but seeing Mom sing along with music, ask Alexa what the weather was and what day it was, observing while she interacted with two of her grandchildren who are hundreds of miles away...well, that was priceless to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've even bought stuff from Amazon with it, which is the last thing I expected to do. I'm not a music in the morning person, but it sure is nice to say ""Alexa, play Beethoven"" and then follow that with ""Alexa, turn off the music in 20 minutes"" at night.

Williams","As good as the standard echo, but not much more","August 14, 2017","I am a huge fan of the echo series and own an echo, two echo dots, a tap, and now the echo show. The show can do everything that the other echos can, but it seems to be just a little bit slower in executing any voice commands. The 2 stars comes from the lack of screen use. Camera support is pretty terrible. If you look at any of the camera skills, they all have bad reviews because of how laggy they are. If you can get them working, the feed is around 10 seconds behind the live view. Amcrest in particular is bad, and unless you pay a subscription fee, you can only have one camera that is viewable. Other cameras let you have more, but the lag time is still there. Overall, I use this the same as the standard echo, so it is hard to justify the extra money for a screen, when the best feature (in my opinion) is sub par.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_406?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=406&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Brownell","Surprised how much I've enjoyed it so far.","July 27, 2017","I have now had my Echo Show for two weeks, I wanted to play with it for a while before writing a review.  This is my 9th Echo device I've purchased and I'd say so far my favorite.  I placed it in the kitchen as that's where we seem to use the Echo the most.  I had to upgrade my Foscam to a Nest Cam to take advantage of some of the features. While some may not see the need to say ""Alexa show the front yard"" I really like that it pulls up the cam within a few seconds showing the walkway to my front door. I plan to upgrade my Skybell doorbell to the Ring for this same reason.  We've also used the screen to watch a recipe being put together on YouTube, great way to visually walk through step by step and not have to worry about getting your dirty fingers all over the iPad.  I also really like the feature that I can add pictures via Prime Photos and create a slideshow of my own pictures instead of a single picture or stock photos. My family has really enjoyed this feature as we've pulled pictures from years back and now get to enjoy them again.  One feature I wasn't sure I would care about but have come to enjoy is the lyrics showing up when you play music, sometimes those songs we never truly understood now all make sense!

A couple of Features I'd like to see added/improved:

Ability for the doorbell to ring automatically through the Show so you can see who is at the door without having to ask.
Bloomsky to update their app to give you the ability to pull the device info on the screen w/out asking for it. Also would like to see it have the daily video show up.
CNN, ESPN, and other update providers to have quick videos when you ask for an update.

The Echo Show is easy and intuitive to use. I have two devices and mostly use them for playing music, watching YouTube and controlling my smart lights (z-wave and Phillips Hue bulbs). I also use it as a baby monitor to veiw the NestCam in my son's nursery.

I have used the Drop-in feature a few times. It's easy to use and works well. Contrary to some reviews, I don't think it's creepy at all. You can control ""who"" can drop-in, so only my wife and I use it (for now) on our kitchen Echo. The device in our bedroom is limited to serve only as an intercom so we can talk to each other from different parts of the house.

Amazon did a nice job with this device. It looks nice on the countertop and seems to be getting smarter and more capable each month. The speakers sound great as well.

There is so much I could say about this amazing amazon Alexa echo show. First of the size is really nice. We have had now for a month or so and love it. Alexa is a good listener for sure.
This new echo show has replaced our old alarm clock, it’s crazy because I totally feel like we have a smart house now. Haha

Pros:
•bigger screen
•volume goes up higher
•Alexa is smart, and can do a lot
•easy to personalize
•quickly to install
•can upload app on phone which is recommended!

Cons:
•hard to restart and update WiFi password
•the directions are hard to read.

Overall, I am so happy with the purchase of buying this. I feel like I have a smart house now since I have 3 of these!

Have you, both of these Shows never leave the place they're sitting and are in both in mint condition.  I sent the one in that was flickering and got back this beauty tonight.  There are about 5 small dent areas around the rim of it and about half of the entire face that the speaker holes are on has a weird film/discoloration that can't be cleaned off.  I got sent back a terrible refurb for my mint item.  So far, the second one has updated and is working so we'll see how long they last.  Lucky if all the way through warranty If all goes as it has.

We have several kindle fires, so I was expecting it to have similar functionality as a tablet, but videos are very limited and/or complex to get to, and saying ""alexa play..."" seems to confuse her as to whether you want to watch or listen to something, so you get sub optimal performance from both.

No internal battery so can't move device when streaming. Adding new devices and capabilities? Really? A lightbulb or outlet is all they come up with. Now that Amazon has significantly raised the cost of Prime, we consumers deserve more from them. And Alexa will not shop on any website other than Amazon, so no comparison for prices.

The device is surprisingly bad at this. I know there are apps that may be added to the device, but basic search for things like this are lacking and really should be a core capability.  The device also likes to show headlines that are these eye-grabbing but completely useless headlines.  If you're interested in the type of headlines that you would get from a real newspaper, you will be sorely disappointed and I have not found a way to change it.  Great for listening to music when you don't want to pick out a station or for setting a kitchen timer, but overall pretty disappointing in the functionality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately it is not that simple.  I purchased a wave for myself, sister, and parents (3 different states) with the intention of being able to talk visually between the 3 of us.  My parents are 89 and 90 and do not have a smart phone.  It indicates the wave would work with a land line.  They do have wi-fi which os needed.  However the directions indicate a need for a smart phone or the use of another accessory, Echo connect, for the land line.  This would have to be purchased.  After talking to the help desk twice (I was disconnected and never called back the first time) it seems you can not do visual calls without a smart phone and the Echo connect will not do the trick either.  The other features I assume would work ok without a smart phone, but that is not the main reason I purchased this.  Very disappointing, especially form Amazon, based on the commercial and the fact that I assume many elderly folks do not have a smart phones.  My folks were elated that we were going to do this but now......","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I bought it, it was linked up with YouTube, however after looking I found that YouTube is no longer compatible with the Show.  I do like the news flash updates, other than that the screen is virtually useless.  I also found out that you need to have android 6.0 or higher.  My phone is about 4 years old and it is not compatible because it is running on an older software version.  I contacted Amazon and they basically told me that I need a new phone.

However, the Show doesn't live up to the expectations of the others. The touch screen is unreliable at times and the reaction time is slow. Granted, all the Echos are not instant, but this is even slower than the sound-only Echoes. Also, it has more trouble hearing what I'm saying than the other Echoes. I don't know if this a ""training"" issue or if it's a fault in the microphone and AI. Sometimes the screen goes black or it won't play the video I select (usually a night/sleeping video--this is on the table next to my bed). I'm not sure why it does that. I also wish that I could choose to make it go dark. The light can be too much for me at night, so I do cover it with a washcloth to darken the room, even with the brightness settings to the lowest. I do like that I can see the weather on it and items that might interest me and it's fine doing all the stuff that the sound-only Echoes can do.

The sound quality of the larger speaker was desired, and the ability of it to connect with my calendar and give me visual reminders of upcoming appointments etc is nice.  I also like to watch videos (TED Talks, etc) while I'm working, and I connect the device to spotify to listen to music.  The ability to do a vdeocall was also tempting and I have tried it a couple times.

My big beef is the video screen quality.  I have had this device since July 2018. Within a couple months, the screen started to flicker and get lines across it. I emailed customer service and after troubleshooting, I had to take it to the UPS store and they shipped me a new one.  Within a few weeks, my new one did the same thing. I went through the same routine., went back to the UPS store and got a new one in a week. It's doing it again. I don't want to go to the UPS store AGAIN, because I have no faith that at 4th device will be any better than the previous 3.  I don't know if this is a hardware or software failure, but the screen issue makes this basically an expensive and annoying echo dot (I have 2 dots and love them).  I've registered a formal complaint with amazon and havent heard anything. Personally, I think I need a refund and a dot, since that's basically what I have.

I have a new home and was thinking of going Alexa for my smart home devices, but based on this experience I might need to go google home.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_91?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=91&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For example the CNN app, can't select the video you ask it. It'll keep playing older videos in a loop so if you ask it to play video 1, it'll play a random video in the list.

Clunky interface to just about anything that relies on the screen and this only serves to show how weak Alexa's natural language processing is.  Here are a couple of things I tried:
1. I had thought it would be great to play music videos while I am cooking dinner.  Hard to find any way to successfully ask for this but was eventually thought I had hit jackpot by asking Alexa to play Rush music videos.  The only video it found was for Caress of Steel (probably Rush's least popular album) and then it was just a video of the album cover!  To top it off, the video is interrupted every few minutes for ad's.
2. Thought it would be a good resource for recipes, since it is in our kitchen but it's search capability is just terrible.  Searched for Corned Beef Hash recipes just to see what it would find and all it came back with was a variety of potato hash recipes.  A web search will provide a huge variety of recipies.
3. Main screen this morning showed the weather (a single cloud and the temp).  That's great I thought, let me just touch the on screen icon and it will give me the full forecast; nope - you have to ask and then you get the simple spoken weather with no detail.  By this time I had lowered my expectations of what Echo Show could do so it was not surprising that I could not display the weather radar.
So overall Echo Show is rubbish, a waste of money unless you just want to have a poor interface to Amazon Prime Video.  You're better off buying a cheap tablet or sticking with a regular Echo.  Have just started exploring the new""skills"" but this seems to be largely a way of wasting more time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amazon failed with the interaction, if I want to search amazon for something I have to say what I want to search, can't type it in, Amazon should be displayed the same as a computer. Can't turn off notifications or recommendations. But hey, the sound is good.

Update: 8/9/19
Starting to rethink Alexa, thinking I should of went with the Google. The Show to me is useless, I do not use the display for anything useful. Providing information is pointless. I asked Alexa last night, ""Alexa, what is the best white wine to cook with"" She responded with a ""white wine is one that is lighter in color"". If I type that in Google, here is my response. ""A dry white is any white wine that isn't sweet. But for cooking, you want a wine with a high acidity known in wine parlance as “crisp.” Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Sémillon, and dry sparkling wines are especially good.""

"1551346322-13744","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews","William Hardin","Clearly a first generation product but the best option currently out or likely to be released this year.","July 5, 2017","As someone who owns many of these smart assistants (3 full sized Echos, 3 dots, 1 Goggle Home and now 2 Echo Shows) and has extensive amount of use with them, I think I can speak to most of what you want to hear. :)

This review will also address future models from Microsoft and Apple as well.

I gave the Echo Show four stars even when it is clearly the best product released or announced right now. I did this because it is clear that this is a first generation device and needs to design tweaking to make it five stars. That being said, it is the best smart assistant out right now and will be for the rest of the year (if not longer).

Right now if I was purchasing more units they would be Echo Shows. (This is out of the three Amazon products, the Google product and its possible future product with Wifi mesh built in and the Microsoft future product and the future Apple speaker.)

I would not pay more than one fifty for anything without a screen unless you are going to be using it for music almost exclusively (and even then there are likely better options in pure wireless speakers.)

Amazon Echo Show:

+ Improved mic listening. Not sure if this was software but it clearly is able to hear me better during music playback at higher volumes. I have often wondered why Amazon doesn't just automatically cancel out the audio it is playing to what it is hearing as that simple fix would help a lot. I am not sure they have fully done that but they did something that makes the mic more responsive. (Since this could be software related, you might see this fix applied to the other Amazon devices in the future.)
+ First device with a screen. While they are still developing apps to use it, already it adds a bunch of functionality.
+ Video calls! This allows you to use them as video intercoms in your house too which is really handy.
+ Able to take still photos
+ Able to display your photos
+ Able to show things (like the weather, items from Amazon and lyrics for songs)

BUT WAIT, there's more! Yes, Amazon made the screen a TOUCH SCREEN which means it is super useful for those times when selecting something is faster than trying to explain via voice what you want to do. This means it can replace a tablet for some light tasks. One of the single favorite things for me--wifi setup. It was SO much faster just to be able to type my wifi password directly instead of having to use a cell phone and the Alexia app and hoping it will work.

+ Directly scroll through Amazon listings with photos, pricing and details and purchase items without having to have Echo ""guess"" what you mean.
+ Having both a screen and touch sensitiveness means so many future apps/skills will be made possible.

Plus compared to other brands products, nothing is as easy to use or more full featured than the Echo family. We recently purchased the Google Home to keep in the living room to compare it to the Amazon Show we have in there and commonly my wife and I ask the same question of both devices. I was (and continue to be) shocked at how much Google Home's device can't answer or how wordy it can be when actually doing something. For example, this means playing music takes longer to start.

More surprising to me is the lack of progress Google seems to be making on the Home. Amazon's Echos fix/improve nearly every week and you can do things today that you couldn't do last month, yet Google seems to be really slow at adding/improving functionality. And I am not even talking about apps/skills. The fact that Amazon's Echos can do things with Googles products like Calendar that Goggle's Home can't do is embarrassing.

Head to head, 60% of the time Echo is able to provide an answer or better answer to Google's Home's 40%. Now no one can see into the future but it already feels like Google is losing interest in really improving their products.

Negatives:

- Screen should tilt for improving viewing angles
- Camera should tlt for better placement options. This would help so you don't have to adjust where you are sitting/standing. For example right now when I video call my wife I see the ceiling fan unless she stands up.
- Font size should be adjustable in case you have it across the room (could be fixed via software update)
- Audio is very directional, unlike the Amazon Echo (without the screen). I am also not sure that it actually sounds better than the Echo but I will do more side by side testing.
-Design is pretty dull. Looks like a Sony Dash (a product from 2009 which means it is 8 years old in design) except not as good! Also reminds me of the old huge rear projector TVs that Sony and other brands made many, many years ago.
- Seems like it could/should have a battery built in.
- Mesh wifi hubs built in (like Google is rumoured to be working on) would have been awesome.

Quick points about competing products:

Amazon's Echo: Great device but unless it drops to about half the current price, the show is a better value for all the extra features you get,

Amazon's Dot: By far the cheapest way to get started. It does so much for the small price tag but do not plan on listening to music on it without using other speakers. These are nice for less used rooms/spaces.

Apple's upcoming HomePod: While Apple makes great products, this device is not really in the same league as the Echo Show. Apple's Homepod will likely sound better than anything else for playing music but will lack most of the features and functions of the Echo line. Get this only if you want a smart speaker for music and the cost doesn't bother you.

Google's Home: Fine but my guess is that Amazon will drop their Echo's price (not the new Echo Show) to about the same and it is clearly a better product with better sound, more features and more functions. I have one Google Home and have no interest in purchasing more until they improve it.

Google's rumored future device with Wifi Mesh built in: I like the idea but I have been disappointed in the Google home as it stands and Google's mesh Wifi routers are known for being pretty slow so unless they fix that, it seems like a clunker--esp if it doesn't have a screen.

Microsoft's future smart speaker: Typically when Amazon and Google are options compared to Microsoft's hardware, it always is the weakest. From my point of view they are making a device not because they love the idea, but so they aren't left in the dust. It will be fine but my guess is that it will be buggy at times and be very limited on functions. I would certainly no preorder it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_166?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=166&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I knew it could play music from my Amazon Music Unlimited library and from my Sirius-XM account which I had linked, but when I asked for some 40s music, it proceeded to play an internet station from one of the radio hub providers that offer a plethora of stations.  I was even more amazed when it not only provided me with a quick way to check my schedule for the day.  One thing that means more to me than most: its ability to make phone calls.

I  have integrated them into my every day life and have also integrated them into my home automation systems.  Then I received the Echo Show as a gift.  I had never purchased one because the video capability didn't seem worth the extra money.  So far my opinion  hasn't changed.  Amazon needs to develop applications which really take advantage of the screen and make it useful from across a room.

We have the original echo, several dots, and replaced the primary device in our living room with this.  We have young kids that enjoy telling Alexa to play music videos and songs with Prime Music Unlimited.  My six year old loves reading the lyrics to songs she knows so she actually knows the real words.

However, my 4 year old is obsessed with Monster Truck videos and most of them are on Youtube.  I wish google and amazon would just find some sort of compromise because this in the end is hurting both companies.

I would have rated this 4 stars but I also took 1 more star away because the lack of control for explicit content.  My kids sometimes tell alexa to play a song that they didn't mean and sometimes rap music, or even pop music comes on with explicit versions.  If these two items above are addressed then it would definitely be the device I hoped it would be.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

  - Voice recognition works very well, even with my accent

Cons:
  - Calendars are a joke, and this is a big one for me. I am given a choice between 1 Hotmail (personal) calendar and 1 Office 365 (work) calendar (you can also add 1 Google and 1 Apple calendar), and on top of that an Office 365 calendar costs $3/month/user. I chose to remove all calendars, because an incomplete schedule is a lot worse than having to check my phone.
  - Most of my questions have not been answered well (hourly weather forecast, recent events, etc.)

I could maybe forgive the YouTube issue, but minus not being able to watch YouTube videos, it doesn't really ""show"" you anything other than the time and weather. I expect the skills to show the words (like the Bible skill). I expected there to be some animation when you use your smart devices. All you can do with it is watch prime videos and your timer...that's it. I expected it to be a mirror of the fire stick/TV with the companion apps (hint hint...if you make it to where I can watch All of my content: Netflix,  hulu, I wouldn't miss YouTube so much). I've already thrown out the box, so I'm stuck. I'd send it back if I could.

I'm getting tired of big companies dictating how I should use their product once I buy it. I try to research and I still get bit in rear. This is an example of it gone awry and I'm out of my hard earned money. Ugh!

Amazon, please do what you need to do to work with Google. The whole point in buying one is for me to use YouTube videos. You can bet that when I Google a product, I'm going to check Amazon to see if it's there for less (not always, so do check).

I initially didn't get one because it was priced too high and it's too ugly to sit out on a counter. I should have known, that when you're fighting with Google that's when the price drops. It was a good price and so I'm gonna keep it.

The sound is really great and room filling. The screen is big enough that if you're watching a video or a movie while you're cooking or hanging out in the kitchen you can see well enough. Calling on the device is cool especially if you need your hands and you're busy trying to get a meal prepared.

I like it well enough, but you've got to get YouTube back. It defeats the whole purpose of watching a cooking video while you freakin' cook!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The ""Show stopper"" for me was the constant stream of on-screen notifications and ads.  Looked for ways to turn it off or, at the least, customize it  No can do.  Other users have mentioned things that sorta, kinda, shut down the screen but... not for long.  Nothing worked for me.  It comes back jabbering at you whether you want it or not.
I returned it.  Got Amazon's usual good service on the return.

Other characteristics:.  The screen is bright, clear.  Feels small.  To me an ""echo with screen"" goes against what echo is.  You talk to and listen to it.  Don't need to look at it.

She had the dot before this hooked to an external bluetooth speaker.  She was one of those people who really didn't see herself liking (much less using) a smart speaker but after getting the dot, she was hooked.  I had mentioned the Show to her and she didn't really see it being any better than the dot, more like a novelty.  Well once again, after she got it, she is enamored with the thing.  I have it connected to our Nest Cams and she loves being able to just say ""Alexa, show me the front door"" and the camera image pops up.  I moved the dot into the game room along with the speaker and the speaker is more than enough for music and such in just the bedroom.  She likes the function where the words come up during the song along with background information.  She uses it as her main alarm clock now as well.  I got this for 149 during the holidays and it was a good deal for that amount.  I myself like it a lot but cannot see myself buying it for 229.  If it comes down again, I would be hard pressed not to buy another one.

I'm a 68-year-old retired Marine and retired teacher. I've been dabbling with computers since the mid 1980s -- I've built several and have cobbled together components with parts from used electronics stores. I've also done some minimal programming in a number of languages. That said, I'm often as challenged by emerging technologies as anyone of my generation. I had not previously owned an Echo device.

I ordered my Echo Show December 22 and it was promised for delivery December 28. It arrived today -- December 24 -- thank you Amazon! Packaging was more than sufficient and was easy to open with my arthritically challenged hands.

In anticipation for my Echo Show's arrival, I loaded the Alexa App on my iPhone-6 and familiarized myself with it. Also, knowing that I wanted to capitalize on Echo's voice commands, I also installed a third-party app, called TRIGGERcmd (see Alexa skills) on my iPhone and PC. This allows me to open PC programs, like Photo Shop, Word, Chrome, and Facebook, all with voice commands via my Echo Show. I also ordered a TP-Link lightbulb to use in a bedside lamp that's placed inconveniently. I can now control the bulb by a simple voice command via my Echo Show. As my overall mobility is impaired, this is a godsend for me.

Once unpackaged, my Echo Show was surprisingly easy to setup -- I was completely connected and fully operational with 5-10 minutes. The fully guided voice recognition routine required another 10 minutes. Within 20 minutes of having plugged in my Echo Show, I made my first hands-free phone call to my daughter's non-Alexa equipped cell phone. I merely told Alexa to ""Call [my daughter]. Sound quality from my end was excellent, and she said the same, even when I was not directing my voice toward the Echo.

I subscribe to Amazon Prime, and at this minute listening to a lengthy playlist from Amazon Music of one of my favorite singers. While the quality is not as good as my high-end audio system, it's still pretty darned good for a device the size of the Echo Show, and I will be using it a lot.

Obviously, I've been using my Echo Show for only an hour, or so, but I have no problem giving this product five stars because its performance and overall functionality have already met or exceeded my expectations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_126?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=126&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is an outstanding speaker.... full, rich sound and much louder than my other Bluetooth devices. It can function as a small Tv and it is self standing , so you don’t have to sit and hold it . You can ask it to play a song off the top of your head and Alexa will display the lyrics.. just like karaoke ! She does not display lyrics with your iTunes playlist. I can make calls thru Alexa using my contacts , so if for some reason I have locked myself in a room or fallen and hurt myself I could call out to Alexa to call anyone on my playlist. By far my favorite function is that Alexa will read aloud to me from my Kindle! Many books are not available on Audible but are available on kindle . Alexa reads them somewhat robotically and thstvtskes a little getting used to . However, it a fabulously s service and it is free! A minor set back though iscthat you cannot fast forward, rewind or repeat . I’m pretty sure that will be added. Another slight drawback is alexa’s Research abilities. She isn’t quite google or Siri when it comes to research, but hey! that’s why I have an iPad and a phone! So, gotta go.. Alexa is ready to start chapter two andceill read me yo sleep...,","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_83?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=83&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The whole family was really... My 3 year old just got super excited because Alexa finally understands when she tries to talk to her.  Adding a screen was the best thing that could've happened.  In the month we've had ""new Alexa"" in our kitchen (""old Alexa"" moved up to the bedroom) we've already been loving the extra dimension the screen adds.  A few highlights:

*  For those songs that aren't in Amazon prime that we're dying to hear, there's a great chance they're on YouTube, and the Show can now pull them up in a snap
*  I was travelling on business last week, and used the Drop-in feature to visit with my wife and daughter when I had breaks in the day.  That alone made it worth the price.  A friend of mine bought one for himself plus 2 more for his parents and sister who live further away.  Now they can easily video chat.
*  I was pleasantly surprised that it's smaller than I thought it looked in the pictures.  That makes it fit really well in a spot formerly occupied by a radio.

The screen also adds lots of closed-captioning for music and news, and essentially makes a whole new batch of Alexa skills possible that weren't before.  Everything has been working as well as the original Echo so we're really happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, I have since learned that the Echo Show is no longer able to stream YouTube videos! This is very upsetting, as this was the primary selling point which sold me on the Echo Show... without this feature, I would not have paid the $229 selling price! More concerning though is that your promotional video, which clearly advertises the ability to stream YouTube videos through the Echo Show (at about 1:23 into the video), is still available through your product description... that is false advertising!  If the ability to stream YouTube videos through the Echo Show is not reinstated, Amazon should offer a credit to prior purchasers offset the value of the product due to the inability to stream YouTube videos!

The first one I got started flickering and it was located next to my chair so was very noticeable.  I searched online and did all the reset options but still flickered.  Called support and they sent another one.  That started flickering within weeks and I just turned it away.  Finally did the reset options and called again and the tech said to give it a few days and he'd call me back.  Never did and now it just sits unplugged and on the floor.

Additionally, I have 2 echo dots and a full-size echo around the house.  I noticed that even though you're suppose to be able to have more than one echo they seem to just conflict with each other and I'm having to repeat the commands over and over until one of them responds.  Happened with this Echo Show too.

Update 9/29/18

So, about 10 minutes after I posted the review above (where I originally gave it 2 stars) I got a call from Amazon Tech Support.  We spent some time reviewing the items that I had and how some of them were offline (I had unplugged them because of the conflicts) and some were not updated with latest software.

Plugged the Echo Show back in and did an update.  So far the flickering has not returned.

On a side note, I got a Ring door camera and had set up the Alexa Ring option on the app and with the Echo Show that works great.

We bought it to use with the Ring video doorbell.  There is a video delay so that it won't show the front door until after the person is walking away AND there is no way to speak through it.

I have the first Echo, a Dot (with another one being shipped soon!) and this one. I actually can’t imagine my life without Alexa. From timers and alarms, adding things to my shopping list, getting reminders and my morning Flash Briefing, listening to music and my Audible books, turning on the light when my hands are full, and entertaining our 3 year old granddaughter with silly jokes that she goes home and tells her mom and dad, I’ve know that I’ve just barely scratched the surface of what Alexa can do.

My husband was talking about Black Friday sales on some other voice activated assistants but I told him that I can’t imagine anything working better for me than Echo. I’m not switching.

I have the Show on my kitchen counter and I love it. I use it for general kitchen things like measurements and keeping me company with music or a podcast while I cook. The stories that pop up are really fun too.  We have Sonos speakers all over the house and I can control them with Alexa. I’ve also used the Show to video chat with my granddaughter and the quality is a lot better than when we do it on my phone. I’m pretty sure I’ll never be without the Echo (the Echo Auto is definitely going to be on the list soon. I’m very excited about that!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As an example, they can play Amazon's wide list of music and show the lyrics while playing.  However, if you ask to identify the song from lyrics you may know, the devices are totally lost.  If Google is presented with even a small subset of a song's lyrics, it returns several versions of the song(s) which have matching lyrics.

The devices also show a very limited command of ""search"" capability when you stray away from purchasing questions.

Pandora. I have unlimited skips and replay but not on the echo cause why? I don't know if it's Pandora refusing to let me even though I pay the subscription or if it's Amazon in a bid to get me to use their music.
Either way guess who's gone back to just using a cell phone and Bluetooth speaker, this user. If I could return my echo and get my money back I would because there is no other feature worth keeping it. The drop in works well, when the app works properly.

The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo.

For me (and I’m sure many others) this makes the screen near useless. Now, I’m left with 130$ left to pay on this device that no longer serves any added capacity from my echo dot. I saw amazon dropped the price of this now worthless product to aleiviate new customer concerns, but this does nothing for the pissed off customers amazon created by its failure to keep YouTube.

I have 3 dots, 1 echo, 1 show, and 4 fire tv's. So I am VERY experienced at Amazon products.i have been a early adopter to all of them and am very comfortable using them in my daily life. We are not ""newbies"" to voice recognition and have used it for several years
 We  love out original echo, Alexa  became part of the family. We used her all the time for everything from music, to helping with homework. So when the new ""Show"" was announced  I preordered... I was excited about the possibilitys. So we  moved the ""new"" alexa show to  where our original Echo was located in the living room...
Nothing but problems, when we had non before... The voice recognition on this model is horrible, I used to be anywhere in our living room/ kitchen (open floor plan) and she would recognize my voice and command.  Now you have to be right in front of her. I am assuming it is due to the new shape and placement of microphones.
I also have her connected to my wemo switches throughout the house which work perfectly from all the other echoes in the house, the show, I give a command to ""turn on the ____ light"" and I get a response she doesn't understand, I say the EXACT  same command, then all of a sudden you hear ""OK"". It always takes 2 requests to do the command.
Then there is the sound. The new show if far inferior to the original when it comes to sound quality. The original had very decent sound, the new Show sounds like a cheap speaker system.
Simple things which used to be simple such as setting timers and doing math questions have become a struggle...
Lastly... The amount of times she turns herself on with random responses when I never asked her anything. The room can be totally quiet, no tv, no one talking and she comes on and says something like here is your ""npr news""
As far as the ""show features"" there are some cool things like the photo frame and video clips (those are the reason I am giving 2 stars rather than 1).
Do yourself a favor, skip the ""Show"" and stick with the original echo, the show simply IS NOT worth the money, I am very close to taking her offline and going back to the original. For me it's to late to return... Hopefully this will help some people make the right choice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Today, ask that same question, and there are only a few and they don't even meet the search criteria.  Big brouhaha between Amazon and Google and we, the consumer pays the price.

Turns out the folks that were trying to call me had an old cell number (as well as the current one) for me in their contacts.  Echo Show was trying to use the old one (though that was not the number I registered with Amazon.)  Bad News:  Amazon was not the one to figure it out.  My Niece did when I asked her to try to contact me.
Updated to 4 stars for the device.  This would have been so perfect to call my Mom
Update 8/04:  Still nothing from Amazon.  When I email I get ""technical team is still investigating""....frustrating
Update: 7/28  Stars reduced to 1.  Still no solution (or attempt at a solution) from Amazon.
So sorry to have to do this, but I figure this is how I can get a response.  I am an Echo lover, however I added the Show to my list of devices and now nobody can call me on any of my devices.  I called Amazon on 7/14 and after talking for an hour to their first line help guy who had the canned ""did you turn it on..."" responses it was supposedly elevated to Design.  Have not heard back.
Fortunately drop in works, so the person I most need to communicate with can still get me.

We use it daily and are tempted to buy another one for upstairs. Everyone that comes over loves it. It connects with the Ring Doorbell buy saying “Alexa show us the front door” — The features get better.

We debated the Echo products for a while because we're an Apple home. We thought the Echo products wouldn't be compatible so we held out... until this Christmas! We added the Echo Show and other Echo devices throughout our home. Wow, we love these guys. We love the Show so muhc we got our parents one too. My mom just set her Show up and called us from Alaska. I realize we could have just called each other on our other devices, but the show is out and in the kitchen. It will make keeping in touch so much easier. I like to keep my phone on silent, but hate missing called from parents, now that is solved. We love the intercom features too. Being able to ""drop in"" on the basement when our kids are fighting or  reminding them again it's time to get out of bed! It's got a great sound for music-- I don't even know if I have watched TV since I added the show to the kitchen. Plus how fun is it to have the lyrics! Our kids think they're rock stars. Another cool featured with the Show is that it calls iPhone! Just ask your friends and family to add the app to their phones.
My few cons: The contacts-- some people I don't want on my Alexa contacts list, but I just turned their Echo options off. Also wish it came with a stand that you didn't need to buy separately.
All in all-- Seriously, we have had so much fun with this thing over the last 3 weeks. I highly suggest giving Echo Show a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I saw that the Echo Show would be released in 4 days and thought that it would be an excellent way for us and his grandkids to keep in touch since we live on opposite sides of the country....so we bought two, one for him and one for us.

We received our Show on the day they were released and setup was a breeze. My father was even able to get his setup without any help from me, which is a huge plus! His only hang-up occurred when he had to verify his phone number, but after a day or so he called me up on the Show and we were able to video chat without any issue. We're currently working on upgrading his internet connection to accommodate video chatting, but so far we're very happy with our purchase. If this works out we plan to purchase one for each of the grandparents.

We keep the Show in our kitchen and use it exactly how we used our Echo, for timers, weathers, news, shopping lists, and most of all music. We have put our Echo in the bedroom and use it as an intercom as well. Just recently for Prime Day we bought a Dot to put in our daughter's room, so we'll see how she likes that.

It is ALL USELESS for us... DISAPPOINTED...
For the purpose of having the echo show in the room of our elderly family member and drop-in from relatives, sadly, it does not work.

Amazon is supposed to be fixing on this issue with a ticket#, and I am still waiting for their solid update (after several follow-ups from our side).

You can't hear loud enough on your phone app, when calling/drop-in from phone App to the echo show.

I really hope it would be fixed before the return deadline.
-------------------
(Previous Review)
Is nobody else having a problem with the call volume?

We purchased an echo show for the drop-in purpose with an elderly family member.
Only the drop-in feature (with video) is the exact reason we made this purchase.

On the phone (App), we just cannot hear (voice call, video call and drop-in) between iPhone App and echo show.

Just 2 ft away from the echo show, we can hear loud and clear on the echo show.
But, on the phone, we barely hear what the other says into the echo show.

After several contacts with Amazon helpdesk, we returned the first one and tried the replacement.

The same thing is still occurring with the replacement hardware.

Calls (voice, video and drop-in) between the App and echo show works, but you can't really hear what the echo show side is saying.  Putting your ear to the phone is the only way to get sufficient volume level.  What's the point of the video call, if you have to put your ear on the phone, showing your ear on the echo show screen?
With voice-only calls, we tested several times on the speakerphone, sadly, the same - you can barely hear.

The person we wanted to gift the echo show is not likely to yell all the time for the conversations.  She is more like a whispering, gentle old lady.

We don't think we'll keep this, but we might to try the second replacement to see if that solves the issue.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_117?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=117&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Big turn-off for those of us who do not like vampires of our attention.  I know exactly what features I want to use on the Echo Show.  I DO NOT want suggestions for anything else.  Ruins the novelty of having a screen.

I like having my pictures run in the background... until I see yet another ""Try Alexa..."" notification.  The device incessantly tries to nudge you into trying features regardless of whether you have already tried them and regardless of whether you are interested in them.  This is a big corporation using psychological tricks to encourage you to buy more from the big corporation.  That is normal, except for the part of having a screen in your home with non-optional Amazon advertisements showing in a constant rotation.

It has amazing potential but I believe it is inherently flawed. I have two gripes:

The microphone array is facing towards the back of the device because the top of the device is slightly angled. It causes the device to only hear me 50% of the time or less. This was an upgrade from the original Echo which had the 360 array that was completely horizontal and 'surrounding' the device; it heard me 100% of the time, even when I spoke softly or even from around a corner in another room. I have my fingers crossed that they can enhance the functionality with the software but I would expect that the hardware design is driving the problem.

The software is incredibly clunky. I understand that they are working with a screen and have added touch functionality but the original Echo responded almost instantly whereas the Show will stick for up to two minutes before responding or simply not responding at all (it will show the color bar to indicate that it is processing but then do nothing afterwards).

What I do like is the integration with my smart home. I can view my Nest Outdoor cams and the quality is great, both video and sound. I also like how many of the skills have become significantly more interactive thanks to the screen. And the ability to see video associated with my daily briefing is a nice feature.

Spell","I can't understand how the brilliant engineers at Amazon could have taken a device with ...","July 20, 2018","I can't understand how the brilliant engineers at Amazon could have taken a device with such promise and bungled it so horribly.

Let's get the Pros out of the way:

Great video quality
Loud sound
Ability to interact with smart devices and especially outside security cameras
I'm sure the video calling, drop in, etc is great but I didn't get it for that.

Now, the bad:
Prime Video controls are horrid. I had apparently watched the first few episode of House at some point, so when I told Alexa I wanted to watch House, it insisted on starting me on Season 1 Episode 5. No matter how I phrased it, it would not play Season 1 Episode 1. I couldn't even started Ep 5 and just tell it to go back an episode.

Worse, forget about browsing for video. Alexa will show you the top 25 (if I remember right) choices, and that's it. You basically have to use a computer to create a watchlist, and then hope that Alexa will update in a reasonable timeframe so you can play it.

Once you finally do have a video on that you want to watch, god forbid if you have to pause it for more than a minute or two. Do that and the screen goes back to the home screen, and you lose wherever you were in the episode you were watching.

All of this presupposes that Alexa actually plays what you want to watch on the Show, and doesn't take over your FireTV if you have one.

The most aggravating thing about the Echo Show, however, is the intrusive ""Things to try"" at the bottom of the screen. The only time it goes away it seems is when you're watching video. Set up a nice slideshow for your screensaver? That's nice. The bottom third of the screen will be covered by something stupid like ""Try asking Siri to speak like Yoda."" Same if you're trying to follow lyrics while listening to music. After contacting customer service directly, I was told this was not something that can be disabled. I am most likely going to be returning the device because of this. Considering that people have apparently been complaining about it for the year this thing has been out, I doubt they'll be changing that any time soon. Apparently Amazon thinks we are all morons and can't decide for ourselves whether we need a constant tutorial.

Finally, Amazon boast about these being Bose speakers. If I were Bose, I wouldn't want my name associated with this device. Is it loud? Sure, but it can also get very tinny or ever have a very nasty buzz at times.

All in all, I am extremely disappointed with this device and feel ripped off, even though I got it on Prime Day for only $129.99 and the Amazon rep gave me a $30 credit because she too was annoyed by the ""things to try"" thing and felt bad she couldn't do anything about it. I really wish I'd have gone with the Plus instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Where the original echo shows a rotating yellow ring when there is a notification, the Echo Show has no colored line or an icon of any kind to let you know there is a notification. Amazon Echo Tech Support confirmed there is no indicator and stated that we must ask the Echo Show for notifications. So the user has to remember to ask the device. This makes it a very inefficient assistant. In fact I become the Echo Show's assistant when I have to prompt it to read my notifications.
I only get notifications 4 or 5 times a week, but to get them in time to react to, for example, an upcoming delivery notice, I would have to ask repeatedly, every day, if I have any notifications. It would be so much better to walk through front door or into the room and see a moving yellow line letting me know that I have a notification to check.

Similarly, any missed calls or messages that are left on an Echo Show do not have a colored line indicator. On an original Echo there would be a green ring visible on the Echo so the user knew there were messages or missed calls. On the Echo Show, there is an indicator, but it is a tiny green chat bubble in the top right hand corner of the screen with an even smaller numeral indicating the number of messages/missed calls. It blends easily into the background and becomes lost. It does not grab your attention the way a flashing green line would do.
One would have to walk over to the device and look for the indicator. Again a not very efficient assistant since we have to wonder if we have messages and then go and look for them,  instead of being visually informed the moment we catch a glimpse of our device. Echo Shows have blue lines and red/orange lines and white lines, so why isn't there a nice yellow line to tell us we have a notification or a green line for messages and calls?

The Echo Show also continuously displays “Things to Try” by putting suggested queries on the screen such as “Try ‘Alexa, show me funk music.’” These suggestions change continually and can be very annoying. Tech Support tells me they cannot be turned off. If I had known about these deficiencies and annoyances, I would not have purchased an Echo Show.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_351?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=351&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have several Echos and Dots, and I thought I'd replace my NixPlay picture frame and Echo with a single device that does it all.  Someday this will be possible, I'm sure, but I'm not sure it's within reach with the Echo Show.

The first thing that amazed me is that I couldn't control the messages that show up on the screen except for my calendar, etc.  I really don't care whether ""Church Goers Get Wooed with a Loyalty Program"" or ""Firemen rescue baby deer.""  The sound quality is fairly good, as is the (small) screen.  But it's not clear when any of that is an upgrade from the regular Echo.

In addition, it appears that users cannot have the screen turn off completely and turn back on in proximity, something my Nest thermostat as well as my NixPlay do.

Ultimately, I'm sure all this will be worked out--but when ultimately will arrive, and whether it will depend on hardware improvements, is unclear.

I mistakenly thought the Show would be a step up and got it during Prime Week.  Wow, what a disappointment.  First, the sound is much lower quality than the tower, the speakers are only right in front whereas the Echo tower it seems to come from all over.  Also, the Show just doesn't seem to get as loud as the tower.  Second, its hard to tell if she's listening to you unless you go stand right in front of it and look at the screen. Third, for some reason her response time is slower than the regular Echo.  I often think she didnt hear me, then she finally responds.  Fourth, she frequently just doesn't work. I set the timer, it says its running, then it doesn't go off. This has happened several times.  You try to look at something on the screen, and it says ""unavailable"".  Fifth, I was hoping to watch casual shows while Im in this area of the house,, but the screen is so small as to make this useless, again, unless I go stand right in front of it.  I missed the return window by a few days, but Im unplugging it anyway and putting the regular Echo tower back in.  The Show is that bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It still works, but is difficult to look and read the text on the screen. Attempting to return it but instead of immediately offering to replace it ( still under warranty) the customer service rep said "" hmmm I will see what I can do"". Then he got back and said he couldn't do anything, and then transferred me to another department, with ""an extremely brief hold time"". Another long wait. New customer service rep. LONG explanation. Said it was a ""known issue"" and ""would check back with me when they hear from developer"". I was incredulous that they wouldn't just replace it. She would ""check what she can do"". Another long wait. Long technical discussion about amazon return process which i don't need to go in to here. By this point I have now wasted 1/2 hour of my time. They offered to replace it immediately, but I would have to pay  a ""fee"" for this service. When again I protested, she said she would talk to her supervisor and see if they can do anything else. Finally, the made a ""1 time exception"" for me "" as a valued prime customer"" ( been a member of Amazon since 1996) and said she would replace it. Another long hold. Took my address. Another hold. Finally got a replacement, which should have been the immediate response, rather than what transpired.
This whole process bizarre because in the past customer service at Amazon relatively painless.

I use it mainly for a baby monitor which is why I bought the Alexa device with the biggest screen. Unfortunately, after a few months of using it daily, I started to notice lines across the screen that got worse everyday. I contacted Amazon and they were great about having me send it in for service. They reloaded the software on the unit and shipped it back. When I got it back it seemed to be good as new! But after a few weeks of using it daily again, the problem returned and much worse than it was the first time. It's nearly unusable. Now I keep it on my night stand and only use it at night because I can still hear if my son gets up. Defeats the purpose of why I bought it though.

First if you're expecting a lightweight easily portable thin profile device, this is likely to disappoint. Personally I initially supported the low centre of gravity design. I had no intentions of it being portable and while I love my echo dot, I was pleased not to have to find a another speaker solution in a space limited area like a bedroom.  However I found the speaker to be only about 50% the quality of the echo classic.

My biggest problems and the ultimate reason I'm returning it though is not because it's clearly a beta product that was rushed to market. I think I knew that going in and wanted to be on the ground floor anyway.  That said I can't keep the darn thing from going offline and flashing the red bar of death.  This might be slightly inconvenient if you have to say...use it as an alarm to be up for work. I worked with Amazon tech support for hours to solve the issue as I am not having the issue with any other mobile devices in my home including the other Amazon products. Amazons only solution was for me to drop most if not all firewalls on my secured wireless network. This would ultimately defeat the purpose of me using the Alexa interface as part of the automated home, especially the security systems and life support technology like climate and noxious gass sensers.

It might be a cool novelty that I'm just being impatient with, but it's not for me right now.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_101?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=101&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After initially setting it up I had issues with it being unresponsive to touch and voice when playing music and it would sometimes just freeze up altogether. I have had the same issues here and there and can usually resolve them by unplugging the unit.
A few weeks ago I notice that there are verticle lines developing in the screen, like a LOT of them. They do not completely ruin the image/whatever is showing on the screen but do distort it. The unit sits in my kitchen away from any water source and heat and has not left that location since its original setup.
I contacted Amazon and they told me they could not send me a replacement or refund my money so that I could purchase a new one/upgraded model. My only option was to send it in for repair that will take 5 business days to 2 weeks before I receive my unit back.
The timeframe sucks for the turnaround, as this is a highly used unit on a daily basis. I figured since I would be without it for quite some time I would just order the new model, then place that one where this one was, and when this model finally gets returned to me, I would put that one in another location in my house.
These are excellent devices when they are working properly and features are not failing on them.
Basically, every room in my house has an Echo device. I use them for everything from setting reminders, figuring out math equations, keeping me updated on my calendar events, listening to music, making phone calls(they work great when you lose your cell phone), asking general questions, etc..
The only reason I give this device 1 star is due to the fact that it has been glitchy since day one and 5 months into ownership the screen is going out.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wound up returning my Echo Show.
******************

I had been considering getting one of these to advance my ""smart home"" capabilities, but the price was just way too high.  Then I had an opportunity to get it for $80 off.  Still pricey, but I pulled the trigger.  When it arrived, I happily unpacked it and started playing.  Note that we have 2 Echo Dots, so I already had some experience with Alexa, but the added screen was going to provide all kinds of new features.

Ahh, but does it?  No YouTube.  No Netflix.  No web browser.  No access to most Android apps, despite the fact that it (from what I understand) runs Android under the hood.

To be honest, aside from 1) limited video calling 2) being able to view my camera feeds (the main reason I wanted it) and 3) viewing recipes online, the screen does little more for me than to simplify the user interface.  Now Alexa can show me some options that I can view all at once rather than having to listen to her rattle things off and then choosing one.  That's all well and good, but I feel like there's so much more it SHOULD be doing that it can't.  I'd like to check my email, pull up my ChefTap app and select a recipe to cook, or video call someone who doesn't have an Alexa device, but DOES use Google Hangouts.  Can Echo Show do any of those things?  Nope.  It should be able to, but Amazon seems to be doing the thing that drives me nuts about Apple--""you do it my way or get lost!""  Hmmmm...  I'm starting to wish I had gotten lost as even with $80 off, that was an awful lot of cash to drop on a box that does web searches and plays music for you.  I keep a laptop nearby for all those other things I just mentioned and I had hoped this would replace that.  It could have.  But it doesn't.  Now I have 2 devices sitting around and while the Echo Show looks cooler, it is also the one that is the less useful.

I regret this purchase.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From almost every corner Alexa can hear me and she respond appropriately.  Almost every light in the house is connected to her and I love the functionality.  I pre-ordered the Echo Show about a month before it came out and I am disappointed.  Partly my fault for expecting more and partly an inferior product in my opinion.

The screen works as advertised however the touch functionality does not seem to be as responsive as a phone or tablet.  This could just be me but it doesn't seem to take inputs very well.
The speakers sound ok but don't hold a candle to a dedicated Bluetooth speaker you could pickup for $40 (generic) to $79 for a Bose Soundlink.
The microphones do not seem to work very well.  I have the cheaper Dots and they work much better.  I have the Show in my kitchen and when I ask Alexa to start a timer (she is 5 ft away) 4 times out of 5 the Show does not pickup the voice command and my Dot in the other room 30 ft away does.

I was expecting a fully functional Fire tablet with a built in speaker and 7 microphones with Alexa highlighted as the center Jewel.  The show is NOT what I expected.  It is literally the brains and power of a Dot with a screen that displays SOME information.  Yes you can see the words to songs but amazon charges a premium for this service---No thanks.  I really wish this was a fully functional android system (more specifically overlaid with Amazon's fire ecosystem) so I could check emails, view my full calendar, make adjustments to my calendar by voice, manage multiple apps and grocery lists, etc etc.

The good:
-Well built
-Alexa is in there
-Yes the Show is a screen, speaker, and far-field microphones all wrapped into one

The Bad:
-VERY limited functionality using the screen
-Microphones do not work half as well as those on the $39-$49 Dot
-Bulky for what it is
-Not much benefit over other Alexa models

To be fair I have not reached out to Amazon yet to see if my unit isn't working properly in regards to the microphones NOT picking up my voice when I'm in the room near the device.

I would recommend passing on this device at the current price of $229.  In my opinion the unit is worth $129-$149 when you consider you can get a more functional Fire tablet for $49-$79 depending on size/specs.

I would recommend buying an echo Dot and Bose soundlink along with a fire tablet.  Mount the tablet to the wall and have the Dot sitting next to it.  This setup would cost slightly less than the show and you will have better sound, Better microphones, and a fully functional touchscreen for every task chore, video, music, recipe viewing, calendar, note, website to browse etc etc.  From what I understand the new tablet responds to voice anyways so maybe the dot is overkill just get the tablet and connect it to a speaker and you will have a much more functional unit for half the price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

if the echo is still in the room and set up, they should play together nicely or adopt what the other has, which they do not. making it difficult to use the eshow, when the echo has previous user information and services on it. (who wants to take the time to change, ugh..)
on the show- it was a little more difficult to find things those system or network items to change, in addition to changing the screen, when (it took you forever) to find, what you wanted to change (without actually changing the setting up).

When it first happened, we rebooted it and the speaker was working as long as we kept the volume at or below 50%.

Update 1: the speaker has completely died now, nothing we do will get it to work again. We have loved this device up until this issue. If the new one does not have this issue, we will increase our rating back up to 5 stars, but for now it will stay at 1.

Update 2: just received the replacement Echo Show and during the initial setup, the speaker died on us. We have not had this new one for more than an hour now.

My grandkids use it in the kitchen to watch Amazon Prime shows. The current weather and temperature are almost always displayed (on the home screen) which is great when I am getting that first cup f coffee in the morning. While playing songs, the words pop up on the screen making it almost a karaoke machine. When Alexa speaks, the words also appear making this perfect for my hard of hearing husband, even without his hearing aids. Timers that are set can show a visual so that you can know at a glance how much time is left. There is more, but this what comes immediately to mind.

Norris","It is a very good device the Echo Show and it has some better ...","July 26, 2017","This was used to replace a Sony Dash that they bricked. It is a very good device the Echo Show and it has some better traits and some not as good traits as the device it replaced. I'm thinking that some of the things the other one did will be coming to the Show in the future. The show is very literal in what it hears and it takes getting used to which code words to do tasks. An example would be having it play some background music like a rain forest sound. You ask it to play rain forest sound and it tries to get albums by artist about rain forests instead of playing the skill sound. Speaking of Skills, that is what Amazon calls the things that Echo Show learns to feed you content. There are many of these skills and some might be a use as we move forward. I enabled a skill for that rain forest sound but it wouldn't play. The code word matters. Some are ""Play"" some are ""Open"" and then there are others. You would think a sound would play but in this case it is open. Other than that it is pretty accurate when you say something as long as it is clearly spoken. Overall it isn't perfect but it may get better.

With an original Echo, 2 Echo dots, an Echo show and now an Echo spot, this is definitely an Amazon house.

I also own a Echo dot, which I use in the office to listen to music. Sound is not as great as the large Echo but still nice to have in the office.
I use these to call each other (Echos can call each other), so one for home one for office.
I bought two Echo Shows to replace these two. I am not sure about that anymore.

The Echo Show is great and as advertised, but when I am trying to listen to music, there is a disturbing amount of buffering. Exact same Wifi.
The Echo Dot on the other hand, has no issues with playing music, no stop or buffering even once.

So now I use both side by side in my office. I had to change the command for the new Echo Show as ""Echo"" instead of ""Alexa"" so the two don't get confused.
Echo Show is used to call the other Echo Show at home to see the kids.
Echo Dot is used exclusively for music listening.

Would have been great if I could just use the Echo Show instead of having both but after the first couple of hours, the buffering was too disturbing.
Same disturbing buffering with movie streaming as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

About Alexa App, it has one minor drawback though, I was wondering why no one has complained about it. This is my scenario, I have a Echo Show at my house and I have a younger kid who doesn't have a phone, neither do I have a land line at my home, but I have taught my little one how to make a call using Echo show .mom is busy at kitchen cooking some food, dad, mom big sister and brother all are outside and they have their own phones and  have Installed Alexa app in their phones,  everyone stores their legal names or store the name that is popular among their friends in their contact list, but the little sister or little brother doesn't know how to make a call using Full name, neither do the others want to change their names in their phones for their little sibling. Alexa App provides an option in the conversation section to add a contact but you have to type in First name and Last name, you can't skip any of the name columns, My wish here is for Alexa App team to add another column named friendly name where I can type DAD, BIGSIS, BIGBRO and an option button to use this friendly name instead of full name or the option to skip one of the name columns to save a contact, so that the younger sibling can say Alexa call DAD/ Alexa call MOM/ Alexa call BIGBRO, this is one of my requests.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I feel amazon should expand as other cable companies and companies with smart TVs have and add apps. instead of only skills. ex. netflix, hulu etc..

I know.... why would anyone want to watch tv on that small screen when they have a computer or tablet or tv. well... just simpmu because you have the option to on almost all other devices you own. so its just more or less irritating that one of my devices cannot. besides that the echo show has decent sound better than most bluetooth speakers. and music unlimited offers a huge selection at low cost. which is great. that being said I myself have always been a movie and or tv series buff. it's what I like to do so I always base most of my judgment in the streaming capabilities of a system. in which amazon echo show had a lot of room for improvement. but I am pretty sure amazons next device will be similar to the show but with larger screen. so let's see what that version will have available streaming wise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only reason I took a star off the show is it had Youtube support for about a week and then it was pulled from the device as I understand it has been from all fire devices.  That really cut into the content I like to view with the show.  MSN video or vimeo seems like a poor replacement in my view.  However, having instant access to my prime video library on the sharp display is really great.  I do feel that the Echo dot was able to hear my voice throughout the room  better than the show.  Alexa still does a good job of hearing you from the Show.  I only mention that in case your comparing Echo devices.  But we liked the Show so much we got grandma one and now she can start a video chat with the grandkids with ease.

I use it mainly for music and smart home stuff. I have converted many lights and Outlets to Smart Home switches, and Alexa has no problem controlling any of them. I also have several Harmony hubs to control my entertainment devices, and to my pleasant surprise, Alexa controls them beautifully.

I honestly don't feel like the screen brings much to the echo experience, because I find the closed-source search algorithm to be limiting. I initially purchased the Show thinking it would be great in the kitchen for recipes, but I've found that many recipes that I've Googled in the past do not appear on the Show. Due to Amazon and Google's constant squabbling, I do not anticipate this ever getting better. Along those same lines the echo has removed Google Play Music as a source for streaming music, so if you are a GPM subscriber, don't expect to be able to use that on these devices.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The video phone quality is amazing.  I can see everything in the room with the person I'm talking too.  The shadows aren't too dark, and the color is fairly vibrant for a video phone call.  So much better than Facetime.  I can even call my friend from my mobile phone and video chat.

There's a certain amount of novelty in being able to watch the news from the Show.  However, I usually listen to my FlashBriefing in my bedroom while I'm getting dressed in the morning and the Show is in the family room, so I rarely use it for anything accept video calling.  That limits it, but I'm not going to buy another one, it's way too expensive just so I can see the headlines rather than listen to them.

Bad:
For some strange reason, the Show hears it's wake word ALL THE TIME!!!  Randomly it will wake and start talking when no one said ""Alexa"" or anything that sounds like it.  Honestly, it's disconcerting sometimes as it's startles you.  And yes I voice trained, and no it didn't help.

It's really expensive for what you get, especially as it's worthless as a video phone unless you have one and the person you want to talk to does as well.  I got one for myself and my parents so I can see how they're doing physically rather than asking them to tell me how they're feeling.  In this case it was worth it to me, but I doubt it would be worth it to a lot of people.  The show needs some dynamic content before I think it's worth the hefty price tag, especially when a Dot is selling for $50.  It has potential, no doubt--seeing stuff rather than hearing it has it's perks, but they aren't earth shattering so it's definitely not a product for everyone with its current content.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From a hardware point of view my only gripe is sound. I had an echo 1st gen here previously and the sound quality would fill the whole house. Just with the normal noise from cooking and at max volume I struggle to hear the dialog of a movie. My other ding to this device comes with the navigation and video choices. I have a fire tv and expected much of the same, full menus, and apps for programs like Netflix and Hulu. Sadly these simply are not there. Prime Video is the only service that I use and I find it really difficult to navigate. So much so that I use my phone sometimes to find a show or movie on Prime video to watch and then ask Alexa to pull it up directly. If you are using this in a quite setting or for a different use like video calls, I'm sure you will like it but currently it's disappointing.

Very intrusive.","December 28, 2017","This is not something I would have purchased, but we received this as a gift. It's not useless, but the few features that work are easily found on other devices. ""Alexa, show me the weather"" shows the weather, ""Alexa, show me the weather in New York"" shows the weather in NY. ""Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes"" works, which can be useful in the kitchen I suppose. ""Alexa, show me the nearest McDonalds"" shows a McDs that's three towns away, there are two closer locations, but it won't learn that I want to set the one location as a favorite. I got it to play a song from my library but I had to select ""No"" two different times to prevent me from being signed up for the $3.99/mo unlimited music service. The artificial ""intelligence"" isn't very intelligent, it only seems to know a few pre-programmed phrases. Oh, and in order to change any settings you have to download the app to your phone. No thanks.

Update: 45 minutes after posting this review, they called me! The guy was very nice, but really, I wasn't looking for a call. And, if I may say so, it was a little creepy. So take this review for what it's worth - it's just one man's opinion.

We have an echo dot, an echo, and a 2nd gen echo and recently bought the show. The microphone is terrible, I love playing jeopardy and it never hears me and closes the game. When I ask for my flash briefing the video never plays just the sound. Speaking of the sound, the quality is the worst aside from the echo dot. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase and am looking to return. I hope your 2nd gen is significantly better quality unfortunately I cant afford that up charge right now.

Update*** Amazon called me asking me for feedback however did not offer anything aside from the ups label or a replacement. Not even a credit to help towards the new 2nd gen? The kitchen is our most widely used echo and the show belonged in there. I purchased the new ech 2nd gen for 91.00 more I am not happy I have to pay more but this is our focal point for our family... review coming soon on second gen..","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We use it for music (it displays lyrics!), shopping list (you can view the full list) and setting timers (which you can see!). After about a month there was a vibrating horizontal line at the bottom of the screen. Now, after 3 months, the whole screen is messed up. It's under warranty, but I have to find a box and bubble wrap to ship it back, then be without it while they determine whether it is broken, then ship a replacements in 2-3 business days after receipt. Annoying for a relatively new product to be defective and not replaced until after I ship it back. I expect that from many retailers, but not Amazon!

One other complaint, unrelated to the defective screen, is that there is a message on the bottom of the screen saying ""Try ____"" with suggestions of things to try asking Alexa. I have my screen set to a pretty picture and every time I look at it, the message annoys me and there is no way to make it go away. It's like a constant advertisement on a product I paid for, which drives me crazy!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Easy to set up initially.  Learning how to enable the apps, commands, syncing your calendar took some research and patience but worth it.  With my iPhone calendar synced, appointments and notices post on the screen as a reminder for me.  So handy!  Also Echo will give you notifications on your Amazon orders.  Grocery list feature is a plus as well.  Just tell Alexa to add it - done.  Last night our grandson needed cough medicine.  Correct dosage was in teaspoons but the medicine cup in tablespoons.  Alexa made the quick conversion for us.  My daughter was sold when she requested an obscure song and it was played.  Kudos, Amazon has done it again.

One thing a bit unexpected is showing lyrics to songs playing (in case you want to sing along). It can also show images and play music along with other Echo items.
I have only found one problem. On rare occasions when I am closer to a different Echo item this will take the command instead of the one I am closer to. This happens when I set a timer. If I need to get going in 30 minutes I will sometimes say ""Alexa, set timer for 30 minutes"". Then an alarm goes off to let me know when to finish up. Sometimes when I call it out the Show in the next room will take over and I think a timer wasn't set so I will say the command again. 30 minutes later TWO timers go off about 10 secs apart. Weird how it happens but, as I mentioned, it is rare.
Looking forward to finding more things that this will be good at doing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Installation was a snap and it connected itself to the Alexa app automatically.  I'm sure I'll find a zillion uses for it -- so far, I think it's great to be able to actually see my shopping list on the screen and I guess I just like ""seeing"" (as opposed to hearing) the weather, the name (amd lyrics) of the song that's playing and other things.  I just happened to find out about the ""messaging"" feature on Echo today and it works perfectly on this and the Dot.  I must say, I'm especially excited about having cameras at the front and back doors -- I've got two cameras on their way to me.  Once I have it all checked out and am using all the things it can do, I'll buy them for my grown nieces so they can talk to each other while they're making dinner (or whatever) in different towns.  Amazon does everything so extremely well and this is easily up to the very high standard they've created and we've all come to expect.  The Show is nice and heavy, so it's not going to be knocked off the table.  In that I happen to sit right here beside it a lot of the time, I'd like to be able to make the rolling prompts (for videos, etc) stop and let the screen just be dark -- sure as shootin' there's a setting or command for that, so I'm unconcerned.

Amazon music, audible and Kindle accounts are available as soon as you sign in.  You can also expand your music and reading library by signing in to other accounts like Panadora, or Spotify.  Since I've had it for about 1 month, I have only ""touch the tip of the iceberg"" with regards to what Echo Show can do.

I'm pretty surprised with negative reviews and I think people haven't tested the device completely. So far I have been very happy with audio, audio and touchscreen quality.
Overall the LCD is very useful only if you find Alexa useful too. Echo show is not gonna replace your TV or anything, but I personally prefer to watch flash briefings instead of just listening to them or watch a trending(viral) video on YouTube or watch tonight show monologue in the morning.
You can set your Prime photos as your rotating background which is essentially the same as a photo frame.
I like to watch TV shows on my mini tablet and the whole Echo show with Alexa compatibility is just cheaper than my tablet with the same size. For example, you can watch TV shows like 24 from Prime Video.
Almost none of these functionalities are new or innovative but combining them together for a relativity cheap price has made this product very amusing.
Obviously there are some room for improvements which I'm sure with software updates and app developments, we'll see them in the future. I'll probably update this post later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_432?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=432&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was a bit disappointed in that you cannot manage these as individual devices.  You manage Alexa as a whole, for all the people on your account and all the Echo devices on your account.  So, if you have 3 people on your account, then all their contacts get sucked into your collective Contacts file for the entire account.  So, you all could have the same contact, but with different names, etc.  And, my Mom, who doesnt have an Amazon account, nor a smart phone, nor an email address, now had this big pile of contacts in her Echo Show.  And she effectively had the same settings as my Show.

So I had to buy a $420 plane ticket to install it.

Then when I did arrive in NY to install it, found that the device will only use the contacts on my husbands smartphone in Seattle, and his Washington state number show up on the caller ID when she calls her friends.

I had to ask him add each of her friends onto his phone in Seattle for her to be able to make calls on her echo show in NY

Now hubby gets calls on his business phone for people trying to call mom back. Everyone is confused and it’s very awkward.

And amazon will not allow anyone to use their app to call moms echo show without allowing Amazon to download their entire contact list.  So my family will not call her echo show because they won’t give up their entire address book

She enjoys using it as a hands free speakerphone, and playing music and videos.

But video calling is not useable by anyone but me because I’m the only one willing to give up my whole address book - most people we know balk at this, and understandably so.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love this.  I haven't taken advantage of all the features, but I'll explain why I bought this.  My mom has the early signs of dementia and does not know how to use a telephone at all.  She can't dial, she doesn't know how to pick up and hang up.  She lives in CT and I live in GA.  I set this up in her apartment in her assisted living.  Mine is on the table next to my couch.  All I have to do is say, ""Alexa, drop in on .........""  It has a soft tone on my mom's end and within about 5 seconds a picture appears.  I'll call out to see if she's in.  If not, I hang up.  Most of the time she is somewhere in the apartment and can hear my voice.  I have to verbally lead her to the unit so I can see her, but if she didn't want to move we can hear each other fine.  In fact I've talked to her while she is in her living room and this unit is by her bed in the bedroom.  To be able to see and talk to my mom without her having to pick up and hang up things she can't do is a gift beyond words.  I do all the work, logging in and hanging up.  It's a dream come true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also own an Alexa and The Dot.

PRO's

* The Show has a large base and it will not fall over easily and its impossible for it to fall over on its own.
* The Show appears to be solidly built although I am skeptical as to whether it could survive a fall.
* If packed well, could be ideal for travel as you can have an alarm clock, weather and Prime Shows and movies to watch.
* The speaker has a rich tones - audiophiles may not be happy (see below) but this is a hifi device.
* Setup is easy and The Show only has three buttons - its quite user friendly.

CONS

* This kills me - no 3.5mm jack! So, if you opt to use the video chat feature there is no privacy - external speakers only.
* All audio and video chats etc are saved on Amazon's cloud for the purpose of improving the device. Really? Why?
* Screen does not appear to auto-adjust and appears to be dark when viewed in a darkened room.
* Screen is in a fixed position - this is not a device that is not lap friendly. It is designed to sit on a shelf or table.

Conclusion:

Amazon may very well be onto something with The Show. However, in this day and age, many other devices, stream music, play our movies etc it simply is not going to blow the doors off of your tablet....The greatest gift that this device offers is ""voice control."" If you have a physically disabled loved one who has a sound mind but an ailing body - this little device can open up the digital world to them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_256?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=256&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I spoke with two reps (both very pleasant) and was finally told that the advertisements are there to stay.
The advertisements are suggestions such as ""Ask Alexa..."" or ""Try..."", and they are always on (ALWAYS). I've had Echo devices since they were first rolled out and I feel like I'm somewhat proficient at using them. I don't need or want these cards polluting my family pictures.

If you want a product to do anything more, buy a Google Home. The passive Drop In video chat feature I could use for elderly family is the only reason I considered keeping this. In most instances where the person on the other end can navigate technology, the feature would just be creepy. Overall, the Show was a surprising disappointment.

Google Home intuitively does what this doesn't do even after four steps and a series of enabling instructions. Having access to only the Amazon apps and content since they pulled YouTube is frustrating and annoying. I have worked with both Amazon Echo and Google Home. For my uses, Google Home is just better in the vast majority of instances, but the Echo Show was my most irritating Amazon device so far.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_226?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=226&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s seems to be working well and, I consider the clarity of the screen fine, very useable. The response/reply time to a query is (happily) faster than my ECHO Plus. Admittedly, I’ve gone a little ALEXA nuts, I have the ECHO PLUS and the SHOW in the same room, my LR, which is open to my DR and Kitchen, but, they serve two purposes. The ECHO PLUS just hasn’t been as sharp a responder to my voice & requests as the DOTS (in my bedrooms) are and this new SHOW is, but, I do prefer listening to music from the ECHO PLUS. If the SHOW hadn’t been marked down to such and agreeable price, or/and hadn’t had the BLINK SMART HOME Skill I would not have bought it.
I connected the BLINK SMARTHOME Skill, did a successful Discovery resulting in the camera's showing on my list of connected devices. All good, except the SHOW would not work w/the Skill very well. It could only go to only 1 of my 2 cameras and the view was very blurry. I tried re-setting the SHOW a few times and even placed it near the modem to see if that got it working correctly. Nope, it didn't. So, I just placed the SHOW back on my couch side table and did not mess w/ that Skill the rest of the night. All other aspects of the SHOW worked fine.
In the morning the Skill was working as intended. During the night the SHOW and the Skill, apparently, came to terms and had a solid handshake. I've asked Alexa to show me my Hall camera, and my Door camera 3 times; it only took a few seconds for each request to result in a clear view of each area. So, it just needed time to assimilate, I guess.  Lesson: don't get anxious if it doesn't work well, or at all, at first. As long as all are set up and the cameras are shown after Discovery, just give it time for the SHOW and the SKILL to connect well.
Also, the SHOW does not have to be sitting next to your modem for the Skill to work. I have it across the room, approx. 22’ away and its working fine. If you have a truly large distance from one to the other you might need to plug on a Wi-Fi extender near the SHOW to attain a stronger connection.
The only reason I did not give it 5 stars right now is because I still haven’t heard the audible alert on my SHOW, which is supposed to happen per BLINK customer support.  I’m only getting the audible alerts on my phone app, but, I do not want to keep p/u my phone to view activity when I’m chillin’ on the couch. That’s why I bought the SHOW, for the BLINK SMARTHOME SKILL. So, as soon as the audible alerts start happening, I’ll change to a 5 star rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It sits on the kitchen counter and has become a cornerstone of our daily activities. Now that you can name timers and set multiple timers at once I no longer use our oven or microwave timer at all. At first I thought the ""how many teaspoons"" type questions would be a gimmick but I routinely wind up asking for Alexa to clarify some measurement.

I setup the app to know where my office is, and each morning wind up checking how long the commute is. On at least two occasions I've gotten a response that included a different route than normal and known to avoid the highway since there was an accident.

Most of our interactions with Alexa are asking to play some music. Our daughter loves this feature, and thankfully is still being very polite to Alexa, even ending her ""Alexa, play Moana"" with a ""Please""! I'm so proud.

The game changer has been ""Alexa, Play Frozen on the FireTV"" and ""Alexa, Pause the fireTV"". This keeps me from searching for a remote and makes it much easier to occupy a little one while pulling something out of the oven. We use it for turning on and off some smart lights as well but the control of the TV is the smart home item I like the most.

Recipe skills could use some work. A few of them are okay, and All Recipes lets you save things so long as you setup an account with them.

I give it 4 stars due to lack of skills yet to use the screen and unlike  the older echo, unless you talk to echo facing you cannot see the blue light, so need to have a sound to indicate she listened to your command.

The Echo Dot and Echo Show act differently when it comes to REMINDERS.
I an a frustrated engineer who wishes he could get through to the development team.  I two Amazon, ""Alexa"" Echo Shows with the expectation to set and manage reminders for my aged mother... and also to demonstrate the Echo Show capability to the 300 residents at her independent living facility.  After placing the Show into operation, it seemed it was just what she needed.  My siblings and I love the ""drop in on Mom"" feature and face to face conversations without her having to do any computer operation on her end.

After a few days I received complaints from Mom that ""I missed 'ABC' and 'DEF' because I did not get reminders.  Could you please program reminders?"".  Well, guess what...  when a Reminder pops up on the screen and audio, it stays there, blocking all other Reminders until the current Reminder is dismissed.  So, in order to get the Echo Show to act like the Echo Dot, I had to buy a Dot and tape in on to the back of the Show, copy the reminders from the Show to the Dot to make it appear like the Show is doing Reminders like it should.

It really SUCKS that REMINDERS DO NOT PLAY PROPERLY ON THE SHOW.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_148?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=148&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For example, on the screen today it says: ""Try 'Computer open the Fireplace skill'"". If you say ""Computer, open the fireplace skill"" the response isn't to open a skill, it is to say ""I found a few matches - do you mean 'Fireplace video 10 hours, ambient sounds', 'Fireplace sounds', or 'Cozy fireplace'?"". I responded ""Fireplace video 10 hours."" and was met with ""Which skill do you want to enable?"" on an endless loop.

I like my Echo Show even more.","June 30, 2017","Day 3: Alexa gets stupid or loses functions?
Since I made a point of noting the ability to browse Pandora channels in my Day 1 review, I have to note that, two days later, this function has  suddenly disappeared. Now ""Alexa, show me my channels on Pandora"" gets the response ""Sorry, this isn't supported on this device."" Drop the word ""me"" and say ""Alexa, show my channels on Pandora"" yields ""What do you want to hear?"".
---------------
Day 1: First day with the echo show.  I'm pretty pleased with it.  Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:
* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder.  Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.
* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera?) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.
* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music.  That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator.  That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder ""Alexa, what's that song?""
* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them from the Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.
* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.
* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive.  AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_315?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=315&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It will play either a single song or shuffle through many songs by the same artist/group.  The sound quality is very good and I can tell Alexa to make louder or lower.  I spent the first week trying to recall all of the music I listened to when a teenager.  It was great fun.  It's been extremely helpful to ask about the weather for whatever location I want.  Wish it would include 'wind chill' and 'wind speed' since I have to go outside and feed my horse. I've set up a 'to do list' and a 'grocery' list.  I've used it as a 'timer' when cooking in the kitchen.  I've used it as an alarm clock in unusual way.  It's possible to set up multiple 'alarm' times.  I set a ""laundry"" alarm time to put clothes in the dryer while already having an morning wake up alarm.  I need to set up alarms to remind me to take my medicine.  It's also nice to have this in the bedroom to ask what time it is since you don't have to open your eyes it's easier to go back to sleep.  The sound that the timer and alarm make is unique and loud enough to hear from another room.  I can't hear the stove, oven, or microwave alarm if I'm in another room with the TV on.  The alarm doesn't stop until you dismiss it.  Less burnt food!
I still need to set up my two devices so they can work as an intercom.  I also need to set up my Ring doorbell and use Alexa Show to see who's at my door.  I REALLY like calling someone.  The conversation is both clearer and louder (if desired) than what any phone can provide.  The person I'm calling also reports better sound quality.  I probably have arthritis in my hand and it's wonderful not holding a phone.  I'm calling distant friends and relatives more often.
Dislikes are user issues and not equipment performance.  I didn't know what an App was or where to get it.  I've never gotten one before.  Since I have bought 2 of these, I know I should be able to have them play the same music in different rooms if I like.  I know someone calling me can't be answered using Alexa unless that person does something on his/her cell phone.  I know there are other things like setting up the devices like an intercom is possible but don't know how to do that.  I know that I should be able to set up my Ring doorbell and answer the door and see who's there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_109?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=109&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Aside from not being able to adjust the naration speed of my Kindle books, let alone not be able to read them in text format, Alexa doesn't even recognize the word ""Kindle"" when spoken to her. (I was hoping she would give me some options for accessing my small library of Kindle books. Lotsa luck with that! )

I did get a kick out of Alexa reading my X-Rated Limericks collection Kindle book. She pronounces all of the nastiest four letter words with perfect rhyming inflexion. And yet, refuses to play certain rap songs!

Great for weather, lists, calls to/from my phone......but all of these super features are non existent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_89?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=89&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just got back from my trip to Australia and it works great with mine here. Because my mom doesn't have a cell phone, I downloaded a second cell number (an app) and set her up on Amazon. Then registered her with the second cell number. It all works great. She no longer has to push buttons or remember things, I typed up a little note and stuck it to the top that says Alexa dropin on Samantha and also Alexa skype Roland, she has no problems now and is so happy to be apart of the family again. This has been invaluable to me, a few times I had tried to call my mom and she forgot to hang up the phone properly so I couldn't get through for a couple of days, she also fell once and was laying on the ground for 4 days before anyone found her, this may not be the only answer but along with the panic fall pendant and daily calls with this I feel happier knowing she is ok. She had purchased a smart Samsung tv a couple of years ago because it had the skype app but they took the app off the tvs, she can finally speak and see her son, grandkids and great grandkids in Germany now and be apart of the family again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

MacBook’s, Apple TVs, Watches, all iPhones, etc. You name it. We use it. But once I saw that the Echo Show had a screen I was so GAME, this was also after the HomePod from Apple was released (no screen). I wanted to try it out so badly, I have a few regular speakers but never bought a home smart speaker before, so this was entirely and completely new for me, and let me tell you, so far so GOOD.
Just like Apple, the packaging was very nice, lots to open and unwrap, all clean and dust free. The set up was okay, it took a while but my Wi-Fi is not the best so It could have just been personal reasons. And once it turned on I was like, “uhhhh what do I do now”. It was just a screen and nothing really happened besides a little video beforehand on what it can do. I started to ask it questions and downloaded different skills and what not and it became easier to use.
The quality of the audio is amazing, it gets very loud stays very clear. The 7in screen is also very high definition, as well as the 5MP front camera. I then downloaded the Alexa app and video chatted some people which was so awesome to do so in the kitchen as I was just cooking and cleaning, etc. It felt very futuristic.
Now if you’re looking for something mind-blowing and life changing this is not for you. This is a massive step for the Echo devices and I am very happy to own one. It’s enjoyable and easy to use. The more skills you download the more I found out it can do so much more than I really thought. I like the news apps and the sound making apps.
Aesthetically speaking it looks so sweet, clean and futuristic just sitting in my kitchen with the home screen always on and ready to be talked to. And I probably love that the most. Just a little ""smart-home-TV-speaker"" just chilling in my kitchen. This device and future ones have so much potential in the home and can really change the way we live. I really enjoy being an early adopter of technology to see which direction we are headed in and this is a great start.  Amazon is seriously killing the game and I am so excited for their future! Another PLEASED customer!!

-The Alexa app, sorry to say, but it's absolute garbage. The UI is okay but it has a lot going on and it isn't too helpful. It's very slow and when you tap some settings it says it doesn't work, or check your connection, etc. Every option you press on the app must load and buffer which is very annoying. They really need to fix and update the app because that's where you manage 100% of what you're doing on your Echo Show.
- I wish it worked with Apple Music ha ha ha... wishful thinking. I know.
- I love the “Do Not Disturb” setting. You can turn it on/off from your Echo Show and the Alexa app. I don’t want friends/family video chatting (dropping in) on me drunk at 2:00 am when I am sleeping.
-I like that you can change the background home screen, but wish it was brighter. I can’t really see it too much.
- “Voice Training” never works for me and I want it to work!

UPDATED- (8/29/17)
-I turned on the voice purchasing feature and it’s easy to use. The only thing I do not like is it will show one item and then you must say Alexa next, Alexa next, Alexa next as it’s going through each option 1, 2, 3, etc. It’s a lot of work. You can just use the screen to swipe through the items but I want to use my voice not my fingers. Also, the password option is nice because you have those friends that come over and say “Alexa, order 10 Xbox’s and then your bill is $3,000.00 and it’s not funny…
-I added my work to the address list and it’s a great feature to show you the traffic and how long it would take to get to work. It also shows alternative routes on the same page. Very useful.
-I still use Amazon music everyday with the lyrics on the screen, very cool to watch.
-I downloaded a few games to play by myself and with others. It’s fun but not very practical sitting around a little box with people playing games on it.
-The video calling/dropping in is my all-time favorite feature. I use it all the time and my family drops in on me all the time and I’m like oh hello there! Awesome feature! But you need to be safe and careful with it. Make sure you read on what it does and how to turn it on/off for certain people.

UPDATED- (9/27/17)
YouTube is NOT supported anymore on the Echo Show AHHHHHHHHH! If you like to watch music videos, cooking lessons, etc or just free music in general you can't anymore.

UPDATED- (10/19/17)- **FINAL UPDATE**
**Here me out on this one. Due to features being removed, the app not working seamlessly with an iPhone and the lack of skills that actually will help someone with their day to day lives, I packed up my Amazon Echo Show and will not be using it furthermore.
-This is NOT by any means a bashing negative review full of hate, it’s a review by an honest regular tech user and someone that enjoys new technologies. The Echo Show has a long way to go and this is only generation 1. Think of it as the iPhone 1, or generation 1 of anything. Future improvements only make the product better, and that’s what I’m going to wait for. There are many skills that are not useful and more gimmicky so to speak, to have you download it and use it when it’s actually not improving your day to day life.
-The software needs some major upgrades that make it easy to use and navigate(The Echo Show and the Alexa App). With the removal of YouTube, there is no reason for me to have a screen because I will not be watching any other video content on it while sitting in my kitchen.
-The hardware of the device is great. The screen quality is HD as well as the high megapixel camera for video chatting. The speakers are crisp, loud and very clear.
-if I were to recommend this device to someone I would recommend it to someone that wants a nice quality speaker that you can use with your voice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It's pretty much as described here. I waited awhile to see how things went with it, but then decided to go ahead and ""jump in"" as they say. Certainly, there's room to grow, but the current experience is very good, especially for PRIME members. I will be updating this review as I have more experience, but I wanted to post today to highlight one new development.

As of late today (9/26) Google has blocked the Echo Show from accessing YouTube. Now I have been using my ES to watch YouTube and it's great, so this is very disappointing. Amazon and Google have given conflicting statements. So we'll wait and see what happens. However, I think Google is making a huge mistake by doing this. Google is just begging Amazon to set up a competitive service of their own by doing this. Amazon could easily create a YouTube like service for the Echo Show.  Sure, YouTube has a huge lead and it would be tough, but Amazon has everything they need to set up a similar service and I bet they could do it fairly quickly if they choose to do so. But let's hope they work things out soon and YouTube returns to the Echo Show.  [***Update: While losing this feature is disappointing, the Echo Show still has a lot to offer, including things like CNN, Prime movies/videos, and so on. So I think some of the reaction here in reviews is a bit overdone. I am using my show every single day and getting a lot of value out of it. Even when just listening to music, the visuals (album art, song and album titles listed, time line, are all very welcome - like on a tablet. The most apt comparison I can think of is the old Sony Dash, only with more potential. And who doesn't think Amazon is going to address this one way or the other?***]

Meanwhile I've got Prime Videos, Movies and TV I can watch and that all works great. Some people think the screen is too small, but I have watched videos on small screens for years now and have become quite happy and used to it. If it's sitting on your desk about 20 inches away, believe me, it's fine for casual viewing. I watched ""Ex Machina"" last night and enjoyed it very much. [***Update: Have watched many more movies and vids and still loving it.***]

The Echo Show has a great deal of potential, but is already a lot of fun and very useful right out of the box. Setup was simple and easy. I had no trouble at all. Speakers sound pretty good and the screen looks nice. Oh, and the new musical ""device grouping"" available is fantastic. It was very easy to create an ""Everywhere"" group and add my Echo Show and older Echo in it and now I can say ""play <music> everywhere"" and listen on both devices. I plan to add more devices later. It's a very useful and superb feature. [Still loving this new feature!]

One thing I learned quickly, is that it would be useful to be able to swivel my Echo Show (since I use it close by on my desk, but would be just as useful in a kitchen, for example). And so I did some research and found this very inexpensive and nice turntable that fits my ES perfectly: Lazery Collections Gripped Bottom Cabinet Turntable Lazy Susan (9-Inch) -- it has a nice soft, rubber pad and non-slip rubber feet - perfect!

All the many skills are even better on the Echo Show. Especially lists and reminders. The CNN Videos (""Open CNN"") are great. Usually updated within the last 2-6 hours (plus many older clips). Often same as those linked by online news stories. It also seems to stream video (""Latest Video"") delayed by a few hours which is nice.  Very convenient way to check on latest news events and the video and sound quality is excellent. The CNBC skill is also very good (""Open CNBC""). Audio with visual text. Market news, updates, and quotes and was real time when I checked. Nice!

Prime movies are great. Prime music is great. I can listen to all my CD or mp3 music purchases (""autorip""), Prime music (millions of songs), and the music I have uploaded as well. Nice! So far, I'm very pleased. More to come as I have more time with my new ES!

*** Update: See updates above. I am still enjoying my Echo Show very much. I use it every single day. And it will only get better.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_331?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=331&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I get all my daily updates first thing in the morning as I fix my breakfast and have fine tuned the flash briefing with the things that are most important to me. I do wish there was a greater integration with my iPhone, however, for receiving messages and calls. I do like the fact that I can make direct calls through the Echo interface though. That's especially handy when I'm cooking or cleaning in the kitchen and want to make a hands free call. I do believe I would enjoy it more if more people that I know had one or had the add so that we could video call. However, despite my suggestions, the cost of the Echo Show is a bit high and most everyone uses different means of video chat already, such as FaceTime so are reluctant to add yet another app to their devices. I do have an issue finding that many of my questions for Alexa receive the ""hmm, I'm not sure about that"" response if it's a web info type search. I think my favorite features are the recipes, local news and weather, timers, audio books, integrating smart home devices, and fun games like Jeopardy and Guess the song. With all that being said, I do feel like new and better options are being added consistently to make this a very user friendly device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have had only problems with this system that was off-line far more than it was working as advertised! I ordered two Echo Shows in desperation and they are working very well! The only time the intercom in my husbands workshop didn't work was when he needed the power cord to test something else he was working on. Once plugged back in it was back online instantly. It was necessary to create a new amazon account for my husband and list his account as part of my ""household."" Now when I need to talk to him I just ask Alexa to call him! Works great! I also like that I can view the cameras, the ones that I installed and are not part of the automation system. It works pretty well but is a bit slow initiating. Whether that's Echo or the cameras themselves, I haven't delved into as yet.

All the other function of this Alexa work as advertised but strangely I find I use it far more than the Echo dots that I have in various rooms throughout the house.

Many times I can barely make out what's on the screen.  I tried to take a video and picture, but it would only let me post the picture on here for you to see.  While Alexa herself still works....I bought this particular item to see what's on the screen and many times I cannot make out what's on the screen (when looking at security cameras, video chatting with family, etc) which makes this device no better than a DOT.  I had high hopes.  If you google it, you will see others have had the same issue and are stuck like me.

Mervine","Great focal point in our Kitchen","August 7, 2018","We are huge Amazon Echo fans. While we are primarily an Apple Ecosystem, I standby these Echos as they been in our house since day one. Aside from one Echo, five Echo spots, and one Echo spot, I wanted this Echo Show for a while, but never wanted to purchase it at full price. I waited for this to be on sale and ended up getting this product.

As you may know this is touchscreen, but we hardly ever touch it as we use voice commands.  The video concept is great as I use it sometimes to talk to my wife as I am traveling. I really like the Jeopardy Skill with this. It almost looks like Jeopardy on TV.

There is one feature I don't think that gets talked about too much and that is the calendar feature. As you get closer to an event, your event comes up on the screen automatically. So you have that kid's birthday party coming soon, well now you get gentle reminders as you are in the kitchen. It will come up and tell you. I never thought about this feature until I saw it.

It's also great for looking up quick recipes. It's also great for seeing what movies are playing there with the trailers. One accessory I will recommend looking at is a rotating stand for it. We have an open kitchen/family room concept. So it's great rotating it as you move to the other side of the kitchen island.

The only deterrent is the full price that Amazon is asking for this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Well, it can video chat. That's handy... I guess? It can play Prime TV/movies... if you don't have a TV, or just have a fetish for tiny screens.... but otherwise, all it is, really, is an echo dot with a screen... and why is that? What happened in december 2017 that basically turned this device into an ADA compatible smart speaker, instead of a smart screen? Google pulled Youtube.

Now, I recognize that this isn't (entirely) amazon's fault, and I gave them the better part of a year to correct it, but with the announcement of the Gen 2 echo show, I thought it was high time that I wrote this review and point out that any use-case that you might think you have... for instance watching cooking shows in the kitchen, or using the show like a voice-interactive recepie book... things that are literally the main selling points of this device, they went MIA when google broke this device and Amazon has yet to come up with their own content to even attempt to replace what was lost.

Alexa's recipes suck. When you say ""alexa, show me how to make ________"" it will show you pictures of multiple recepies and say ""tell me what you want..."" And that's it. No matter what verbal command I try, ""alexa, show me the 3rd one"" or ""alexa, show me ""red's famous chilli"" or ""alexa, yes"" it does not provide an actual recipe... so that feature is worthless.

Most of the rest of the features that utilize the screen require you to spend money... for instance, it won't let you ""watch live TV"" unless you have a login for the ""live TV app."" Which, again, I don't fault them for, but i'm not going to pay $50/month JUST to get CNN live.

So, how do I actually use my $200 echo show? In real life? Well, I use it the same way I use a dot. Setting alarms, asking questions, turning the lights on and off... Listening to music/Audiobooks. (and on that front at least, the show DOES have a good speaker for it... I noticed that the new model has rear facing speakers. I wonder what on earth they were thinking there?) but mostly, without Google/YouTube, all the things I want to do with echo show: Watch movie trailers, product reviews and demos, whatever... That content just ISN'T AVAILIBLE anymore and my single, most commonly used command is ""alexa, screen off"" How sad is that?","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Until 2017/09/26 Echo Show would play YouTube videos by asking ""Alexa play funny cats on YouTube"".  However after 09-26-2017 Alexa responds with ""YouTube not supported on Echo Show"".

Speculation: this is because YouTube videos would just play, without commercials, it was the way the internet should be on a appliance / purpose built device like Echo Show.  Google has likely blocked the device based on the http request info provided that identifies it as Echo Show vs. a standard computer web browser.

Amazon can resolve this by working with Google (yes a competitor) to create an Alexa skill to play YouTube videos.

We could listen to music, my son could watch his prime video shows at the counter, we even used it to stream the front porch camera.
The problem started with the background display. We have chosen the option to cycle through 'on this day' photos from our amazon account. I first noticed it had been stuck on a photo from a few days prior and not cycling. No big deal. Then the video streaming from prime videos would only play for a few minutes before returning abruptly to the home screen. Music glitches in and out.
As we said, we were really happy initially, but seems amazon still has a ton of coding bugs to work out with this thing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_101?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=101&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After searching the internet I see display flickering is not unique to my device. There could’ve been a bad batch of display screens.

However I really wanted it so that I could see my recipes on Pinterest (instead of using my phone) but the Show does not let me access Pinterest. It does offer some recipes from Allrecipes but not nearly what you can access or store on Pinterest Also when you ask to see what is on Amazon Prime she only shows you 25 shows...the same 25 shows each time you ask. So if you want to see some thing else on Prime you need to ask for it by name. Also it would be great if you could stream other providers such as Netflix. Overall I would rate it as just ok. Hopefully Amazon will provide updates to resolve these issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I named the Echo Show my Ms Show-n-tell and she is exactly that.  She shows and tells me everything I ask of her.  I also bought a wall mount for her but I like her better on the counter tilted a shade backwards sitting on the mount. Nothing but good words from me and I promise you will enjoy having yours ! Tons of cues that run on the screen at the bottom like happening now, trending things, weather, things to try. You can change the wallpaper with your photo's. the sound is great and when you connect all your echo products like mine are, when you play music the sound echo's thru the house.

It’s been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made! After we all got used to how to use them, we have found them to be an exceptionally good way to communicate! We have had some great conversations and fun times using the many features it offers. All of us are staying in touch much more often now than we used to. My grandson calls whenever he wants which is a plus for us since we live in New Mexico and he lives in WA State, as do our other children. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of speakers on the Show. The sound is great and truly amazing!  We use our Echo Shows to communicate on a daily basis...actually sometimes several times a day!

They limited the functionality in the hopes of getting people to be more reliant on there streaming.

Unless you're nearby and facing the Show, the voice recognition is terrible.  I have mine in the kitchen and when I'm in the living room, it's about 12 feet away and I'm facing it's side.  It hears my commands maybe 60% of the time while my original Amazon Echo which is in the bathroom much farther away has no problems hearing my commands in a normal tone.  That really surprised me.

We use the video chat from the upstairs bedroom to the down stairs kitchen or even from our cellphones when one of us is out and about. I like the visual representation of the weather and other little things like that. It's also great for quick entertainment for children and cartoons.

My wish list:
Better App- I use the shopping and to-do list a lot but I think the app could be so much better as your home control station and planner
Recipe Box- This would be super convenient for my kitchen Echo if it would leave open the recipe and I could ask for it to read the next line.  Even better if they would partner with HomeChef and have their recipes and I could pick my future orders.

Berry","No wonder they discontinued it.","October 21, 2018","MIne worked for about two months before I had to send it in for a ""repair"". The screen was flickering which was a common problem. They re-loaded the software and sent It back. Then it worked for about three weeks before the symptoms returned. Now it flickers for around two hours every morning then starts working. It's past the warranty period now and I know I should have kept returning it until it worked but I had the feeling it would never work correctly and didn't need the hassle dealing with it. Life is too short so I consider it money wasted. Amazon should buck up and send me their new model in exchange but somehow I don't see that ever happening.

I love the fact that you can upload your own photo to be shown on the home screen. BUT, as I've read some of the other reviews and I know I'm not alone here, PLEASE GET RID of the, ""Try Alexa"" suggestions and the ""Flash Briefings"" that pop up on the home screen. It's very distracting and annoying. I mean seriously, if I want to try something I'll ask the device to try it. And I really don't care that Themed candy was handed out at the UN (which just popped up on the screen). If I want flash briefings, I'll ask. If anyone from the ""UPDATE DEPARTMENT"" is reading this, please get these things off the screen. Or give us an option to turn them off. KEEP the time and weather though, that's actually the only cool thing. It would be great to simply listen to music and be able to look at the photo you uploaded without all the distractions popping up.Until then, I'll leave the screen dark.

Eydenberg","Good overall, can get even better with updates.","October 30, 2017","Let's start this review at where I was when I made the purchase...that was skeptical.  I am happy to say that after living with the show for 3 days now I can positively say that this device is a great companion to the original Echo and has potential to an unbelievable product.  Here are my pros and cons so far:

Pro
-High quality screen, albeit just a smidge small
-Good audio playback, I would say slightly better than the original Echo
-Integration to other Echo's to create playback groups is awesome
-Screen in general provides a whole new experience (skills like Jeopardy are awesome and the lyric playback feature when you have music on is great.
-Nice compact footprint, photos make this look bigger than it is.
-Photo booth feature is great for parties

Con
-Recent loss of support for YouTube
-Settings limitations (ie. I would like the home screen photo that is linked to my Amazon Prime Photos to change more frequently.  This should be able to be user defined to operate as a photo frame, however this is not the case.  You can work around it by activating a slide show, but that's an extra step that should not have to be taken.  I'm sure this can be fixed in an update...wink wink!

Overall, it has been a great experience so far.  I look forward to features that may be added in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But it doesn't do several pretty basic things and they are software/design issues.

First primarily I want this to be a video phone between my children and my parents. But this should also be easy to for my parents to use as a video phone with the other grand kids and it is not. Everyone else has either a kindle fire or an iPhone/ipad that can have an alexa app loaded onto it. But basically it is impossible to use for video call to a non-alexia device.

And even my own iPhone can't easily call my own Echo Show without using drop-in. I don't want to use drop-in, I want to use it as a video call, with a real ringer and the ability to answer. But if I am calling a Echo Show on my own account (both mine and my parents are on my account) the only option is drop-in, even if drop-in is disabled.

My 4 year old isn't too bad at using it after a couple of weeks of trying. For Prime videos, I have defaulted to using the watch list because the Echo is dumb about choosing a show when some seasons are on prime and some are not. It will almost always say they can't be watched because they some of the seasons are not available. A similar problem with shows you have purchased. I can get the Show to play them if they are on my watch list, but not if I just ask for them to be played.

Also I wish there was a way to set up parental controls on a device without setting up parental controls in the whole account. My parents have a kindle fire on my account. But if I set up parental controls on the Show, then my parents have to log onto their fire to prove that they are of age. Yes I could solve some of these problems if I kicked my parents off of my Amazon account. But I don't want to do that. My dad likes to be able to read on his kindle and fire, but can't get to books easily. So he asks me to push books to him. That is easy enough for me to do as I have it set up, but it requires that I leave parental controls off of the account as a whole.

I have played with adding smart plugs and a smart light to my house to be controlled by the Show. It works about 80% of the time as it should. Which is annoying. I don't expect perfection. But sometime I just want things to work the way they should.

Also having a Fire TV stick in the same house as the Echo Show is annoying. When the Echo starts thinking you want it to show something on the Fire TV, you basically can't get it to limit it to the Echo Show.

The summary version is that like most Amazon products (except the eink Kindle line) this feels like a beta product. I don't want to pay $300 for two Echo Shows and then wait for stuff to work right.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They do not have a mobile phone, so I cannot set up the Echo Show for them to receive calls.  This could have been the perfect phone solution for people with poor vision and dexterity, or with Parkinson's Disease.  Regular phones can be difficult to use for those who can neither remember nor see phone numbers but remember names. This device cannot be used properly by those without a mobile phone.

Update: Amazon called me within minutes of posting this review and offered some work arounds. Great customer service!  The device can be set up on my account as one would for a child with just a few contacts.  One can also use an old smart phone and a cheap temporary SIM  card, just to set it up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The ""Alexa, show me the Nursary"" seemed like a great idea, and I am already a fan of my Echo and several Echo Dots. But what is less obvious from the video is that the cameras used for the baby's bed appear to be Netgear Arlo and do not support audio. They must be using a traditional baby monitor for audio and when they hear the baby cry they ask the show to let them see the camera. For us, the time that it takes to do that we could just walk to her room. So the devices aren't exactly doing what I thought they would. I purchased an EZVIZ mini pro camera for the baby's bed and the EZVIZ app supports audio and only had about a 4 second delay and the Show doesn't support audio and has about a 25 second delay. It's really disappointing. The Show is cool for the little music and video things that it does, but I am either going to have to find a camera that will do what I want or find some other task for the Show to do.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_96?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=96&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We got this to “upgrade” our Gen 1 in the bedroom.

We immediately tested it along side our Gen 1 for audio quality. The Gen 1 was louder and had a more solid base and subwoofer.

We then tried to use commands that you can’t do on a Gen 1 Echo like watch videos. As several users have pointed out, there is no YouTube. So instead of loading other video repositories on the web, it attempts to load YouTube and then errors out.

***UPDATE*** 48 hours after connecting the device, it did begin to correctly react to requests to play videos.  I suspect there was a software update that ran and now points it the video repository (not YouTube) that Amazon uses.  The videos are good quality and definitely improves the overall value of the device.  i have updated my review to 3 stars.

The one saving grace is that the lyrics displaying while songs are playing is cool.

You can video conference different rooms within the home or to friends and family who live across the block or across the country.  There are several apps (Amazon calls them ""Skills"") that you can download for free which help expand the usefulness of the device.  It is great for music fans and is obviously designed to work best with Amazon Music.  It is easy to pick up on how to use all the functions.

The biggest problem is that the disputes that Amazon and Google are having with each other is preventing YouTube from being displayed (at least as of the time of this review on 12/09/17).  If your primary reason to purchase a Show unit was to be able to use it in the kitchen and watch food prep videos via YouTube you are at least temporarily out of luck until Amazon and Google can come to some sort of terms.  At this point you may as well save your money and just use your tablet or phone.

It could also become a very expensive paperweight if you purchase thinking of being able to connect into the ""Google World"" and the two mega companies cannot agree on how to work with each other and Google decides to cut off all access to their services from any of Amazon's products which would include the entire Echo family of products.  If they can learn to play nice together this would be a fantastic product.

Until Amazon and Google establish a cease fire agreement I can only give a rating of 3 out of 5 stars.  It would be a 5 out of 5 if I would know the two companies will come to some sort of mutual understandings and put the customers of both organizations ahead of their petty schoolyard arguments.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are buying an Echo Show to utilize a security camera that says ""Works with Alexa"", It wont do 2 way audio!","March 18, 2018","I have to say that I am a very big amazon device supporter as I have several of the Alexa devices. I recently wanted to be able to see and hear what was going on with an outdoor security camera that I got the day after getting the echo show which was the only reason I got the show. The camera was a highly rated one with 2 way audio, etc. Description said ""Works with Alexa"" as many of the better security cameras do. After installing I find out that I can see the live video on the echo show but there is no 2 way audio. I couldn't believe this so I started a chat session with Amazon support and they sent me to 3 different ""groups"" and passed me to 7 different support people including the ""Camera"" group. No one could answer my question and was very hesitant to make any claims on way or the other. I believe that there is much mis leading information and claim made by not being specific that 2 way audio is not supported on the echo show. I was made aware that the amazon cloud cam may be able to do two way audio but I wanted an outdoor security camera, not an indoor camera that will let Amazon deliveries in the front door. All the claims from several security cameras including the companies purchased by Amazon are quick feature the 2 way audio while stating ""Works with Alexa"" It needs to say ""Only half works with Alexa""!!

The shows can ""drop in"" to each other without problem.  The shows can also drop in to the dot.  However, neither show can drop into the original echo.  In fact, when I want to drop into the echo from either show, I will instead be rerouted and drop in to the other show.  In addition, I have one show that is connected by Bluetooth to my receiver.  I always disconnect the Bluetooth when not in use.  However, when I when I want to drop in to that particular show, it will connect by Bluetooth to my receiver, my receiver will turn on involuntarily, and amazon unlimited music will play.
I have spent hours on the phone with customer service.  All echos are updated and been reset multiple times.  I have been told more than once that I will be contacted by a higher end customer service person that is familiar with all the ins and outs of the shows and the drop in feature and together, we will solve this problem.

Alexa tech support has proven equally as frustrating. They have been working the issue for almost two weeks.  Can we just get it fixed already?

Pros:
Literally all other functions on the app and the devices  work better than good.  They work great!!!  And I certainly do enjoy using them.

Most of, not all of, the Techs have been very polite and very professional and are trying.

Cons:
I've spent appx. $250.00 (+) on video equipment that simply does not work as advertised. Had I known this beforehand I would have only bought the speakers.

At first we laughed when we saw it, but then we became very interested in all the things it could do.  We ended up not purchasing it - it cost $500 more than the refrigerator we bought.  Then we learned about the Echo Show.  It seemed to have all the things that drew us to the smart fridge, but smaller and could play music.  And it was less than half the price.  Right now, we're using it for weather forecasts, a grocery list, a to-do list, and music. We haven't bought the unlimited Amazon music yet - just what's available through Prime so far.  We like the variety as of now.  The Echo Show can do so much more, and has the potential for even more skills as time go on.  We look forward to seeing what develops!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_190?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=190&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Setup was very easy, but when I played music I heard horribly distorted sound which I believed could not be normal. I decided to request a replacement. Amazon immediately shipped another unit to me which I received 2 days later and requested return of the defective unit within 30 days for full credit and no shipping charges. After setup, the Alexa app on my iPhone showed the replacement listed as Echo Show 2. The Echo Show was listed as Offline and the Wake Word was grayed out. I was able to change the Echo Show 2 Wake Word to ""Echo"". Bottom line: Amazon's service excellent, product is almost excellent (see next paragraph), and I'm very impressed by its features.
The reason I've rated it with four stars is that the screen is much dimmer than my iPhone and iPad. Ideally there would be voice commands to increase/decrease brightness or at least a fixed level brighter screen. I can't believe that this was not criticized during early panel testing
UPDATE: I updated this review to 5 stars after using the Echo Show for a week. The brightness is adjustable! Tell the Echo to play ""Getting Started"". I still have a few gripes.
Anyone who experienced poor sound should replace the unit ... I noted this comment in half a dozen reviews. In my case, my speaker was defective. The replacement sounds great. I strongly recommend a replacement, it's worth the trouble. My minor gripes: the first applies to all Echos. This is an engineering change: add on/off volume normalization! Music tracks vary in volume and news briefings vary WIDELY in volume. Hopefully YouTube and major cable providers access be available in the future. The only other improvement would be more ""How To"" documentation. Is there a user forum? If so, talk about it in the getting started video. I've discovered that the Echo Show can access YouTube ""Echo YouTube xxxxx..."" This gets gets back to lack of documentation. Very happy with the device. It would be nice if it was portable, had earphone and HDMI out, Could play local TV channels. It's a great bedside unit and eventually might have all these features (some legal considerations). Looks like the 2001 movie HAL computer is actually happening!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_97?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=97&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As with any new product, there are things to like and not like.

Pros:
-You can watch Amazon Prime and Youtube videos on this device.
-Sound is decent.
-Video calling with other Echo Shows or the Alexa smartphone app is good.

Cons:
-No parental controls on viewing Amazon Prime videos.  Need either controls to lock out viewing during certain times and/or a passcode to unlock that feature.
-Takes several seconds for the built-in cameras to focus when calling other Echo Shows.
-When viewing third-party cameras like the Arlo cameras, there is no way to have a 2-way audio conversation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm not technologically gifted by any stretch of the imagine so I'm not a big fan of complicated devices.  The Echo Show has truly been plug-and-play and the versatility of what you can do with it is great.  So far, I've streamed music, listened to audiobooks (via bluetooth played over my phone), and streamed movies/shows.  We also use one in our bedroom as an alarm clock in addition to what I just mentioned.  My husband (who IS very tech savvy and way into jam band style music) took one of these to work and came home raving about the sound quality.  We haven't tried the face-to-face call feature yet, but that's next.

I bought two so that I could check in frequently with my 90-year-old mother in another state.  Setup was surprisingly easy - just plugged it in and connected the Wi-Fi.  It has several advantages for this kind of application over a tablet.  First it's entirely voice controlled, so that once my mom learned to say ""Alexa"" before each command, she was able to access all kinds of information and make calls to family with just her voice.  No tablet to find, no buttons to push - just talking.  I'm able to easily make video calls to my mom with my iphone from anywhere.  It was also easy to connect a Google calendar to her Echo Show so that she could keep track of upcoming events.  She lives in a senior community and has short-term memory issues, so this help with keeping track of upcoming events is very useful.  We used the shopping list function and it worked beautifully - letting her add things to her list when she thought of them and then checking them off on her android phone at the store.  The speaker is great too.  She can ask for Glen Miller music and get a nice selection of favorite songs or she can ask for a preview of a movie she's heard about from TV, as well as getting movie times and locations.

Amazon contacted me and requested I send the device in for a warranty repair. I went ahead and did just that.
I received a message from Amazon stating “We’ve reloaded the latest software onto your device, run it through our diagnostic process, and confirmed that it is working correctly. Your device should now be fully functional and is being shipped back to you. The estimated delivery date for your device is January 6, 2018.” I received it back a couple of days ago and I am continuing to have these annoying popping noises. At times it even feels like it may be louder now.  At this point I have a speaker I refuse to use in my office because I can NOT stand the popping noises. It’s distracting and my customers laugh at the product and its issues. I have jumped through Amazons hoops, I will not be buying any future releases of the echo product line. I wish I had my money in my pocket instead of a very expensive, heavy paperweight.

I use this in my office at work. No matter where I stream the music from, Amazon, Spotify, Sirius XM, Pandora... After an hour or so of listening it begins randomly popping. It will make these popping noises at random times during the song, every time between songs, and if you pause or skip songs. It is unbearable. The only way I have found to temporarily fix this issue is to stop playing altogether, and after a break of about an hour start again. This fixes it for a short period of time and then the popping resumes again. In the few minutes it took me to write this review I counted no less than 8 pops.
As someone who owns multiple Amazon products, this is the first time I have ever had this kind of issue. It is beyond frustrating and I would not buy again. I wish I could return this, but it is outside of the return window. (I bought two, one for me and one for my mom to use at her house. She is reporting the same issues.)","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_204?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=204&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was very easy to set up and integrate with my other echo dots. It has a lot of really cool features like video calling,  and visual effects you don't get with regular echo products. The big problem and the reason for 3 stars is it was purchased with the ring doorbell as a prime day special but go figure, the ring door bell and echo show don't fully work together.  You can ask the show to view the front door,  but you get no notification when a motion event happens or someone rings the bell.  Also,  there is no two way communication between them.  So basically I'm forced to use the ring app,  which defeats the purpose of ordering this package deal in the first place. Very disappointed at this point,  I really hope they add these features in the future.  Amazon you need to be smarter when packaging items together.

I bought two so my Father could use voice commands to call me and to search the internet. He enjoys looking at images of old cars, historical sites and for information about old actors and actresses. When questioned Alexa does not work at all like Google and recently has been disconnected from access to YouTube. All Alexa provides simply is the weather, time and sometimes accurate information about locations and business hours of banks and stores. For anything else, Alexa wants to sell you a product through Amazon. It is very complicated to understand how to use and sync apps. When you use the Wikipedia command you can get some info but only in general not specific and no images. I spent a lot of money for a fancy talking weather clock. My nephew tried to link my Dads ipad playlist to Alexa and only succeeded in somehow erasing the very extensive playlist from the ipad. My nephew is a graduate of Full Sail Media University and an excellent computer graphic artist very familiar with using complicated software.

But the Echo Show is sooo much dumber than the Echo!!  She doesn't understand commands as well and you have to repeat even basic commands.  She will also get ""stuck"" on miscommunication.  Amazon needs to correct this with an update via WIFI before she damages the brand of Echo and Amazon A.I. Moreover, when you are watching a YouTube Video and want it to stop - she will NOT cancel it.  You have to literally slide the cursor to the end of the video.

It's very limited in terms of Alexa's abilities, along with how little you can actually do on the touch screen itself. Everything's mainly controlled through the mobile app. I noticed that Alexa doesn't pick up on most of the things I tell her, but Alexa on my regular Echo Dot seems almost flawless. One of the downfalls was that YouTube wasn't available anymore =( We were looking forward to watching vids without having to use our phones.

I definitely LOVE LOVE LOVE the drop in feature. My spouse and I are currently living in two different states temporarily and this has definitely helped the whole long distance thing. We can both be walking around our rooms, cleaning or doing whatever, and still be able to talk/hear the other person. Even when my spouse isn't home, I can still drop in and see our kitty sleeping/playing. This totally beats FaceTime/Skype by a longshot!

Limited video capabilities, but prettier and better-sounding than the original Echo.  Our real use-case will be tested when my parents get theirs, for Christmas.  We're hoping for some easier video-chatting, without having to worry about computer connections.
My big disappointment, though, isn't with the product - it's with Amazon's pricing policy.  I bought 2 of these, on CyberMonday, and there was a $100 if you ordered 2 at once.  7 days later, they've upped the discount to $150, so I contacted Amazon to see if they'd credit me the additional $50 without making me actually return the units I received & reordering 2 new ones at the lower cost.  Three levels of Amazon support all apologized, saying that returning the products & reordering was the only way to get the additional $50 discount.  That's really disappointing, since other companies in this situation (think Costco, Zappos, REI, etc.) will simply give customers a refund or credit, without wasting time/packaging/transportation/etc. to do a return.
I realize they can't price-match on all products, but they should be able to do so for their own products (Echoes, Kindles, etc.) sold on their site.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All previous bugs appear to have now gone away.

My wife did receive a phone call from an actual person with Amazon today Sunday. He is calling back tomorrow to make sure everything is improving.

Our package was delivered with no one home in Las Vegas on a 103 degree day. It sat out side for 5 hours. So some fear that heat may have caused an issue. But is running fine today. So have adjusted the rating to 3 stars for now...

First day...

So far way more hype then delivery. Perhaps just got a faulty unit. But attempts all day to use various customer service have resulted in nothing!

Won't play any video just says template error.
When reading right off of included card and prompts in app Alexa play season 3 of Bosh (yes we are prime customer and have prime video) it responds with here is season 3 episode 1... and nothing.

When asking to show nearest whatever it gives pictures but all information at top of screen is mashed together and unreadable.

Add on the numerous times she says unable to understand now.

Bottom line some features work and some don't some work but have flaws that don't deliver 100% satisfaction.

Hopefully this gets resolved and soon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seems to me it is based on the other Echo devices so while the visuals are fine, there isn't much additional at the moment (I can see lyrics with music and it shows the words it speaks... useful for the hard of hearing).
This is a device contained in the Amazon universe so if you want to see a video it will be on Prime and no access to YouTube or Netflix or Hulu etc. I have cable so I have access to HBOGo, but I can't access it because I didn't get it through Amazon. Not that I ""need"" to watch movies on the Show but it would be nice to see YouTube. Cooking videos in the kitchen come to mind. And since I homeschool, access to the largest depository of videos on the net would be a bonus big time.
Sometimes we stump Alexa with a question. Like it can't find a picture of an obelisk online, tries to find it in my Prime photos or its own Amazon database and that's just not as good as Google (google obelisk and see how many images pop up and you will see what I mean).
I love the features it does have and I used it to create a ""smart home"" (although 1st generation doesn't have an integrated hub, I use stuff that doesn't need one). Listen to music, drop in on other rooms, have a video call with my husband who used the app on his phone and I used the Show. All those are great. If they can expand beyond the contained Amazon universe, I would love it even more. Worth owning, but a bummer they don't have some basics like a comprehensive search feature or access to subscription services/YouTube.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We are loving it! We have been using it for about two weeks and are thrilled. We purchased the echo buttons and our whole family loves playing the games. This was a birthday present for my 9year old and I figured she and my 7year old would use it as a glorified night sound/alarm clock but they are loving all the free music from amazon prime and the fun jokes. They also love setting timers when we cook and asking about the weather. The music and games have been our favorite though. I love that they can ask for their favorite Christian artists and just get songs they know instead of getting a station that has other junk and ads in it. I did have to set a pin up for instant ordering because one of the kids almost bought a 200$ pair of Jordan shoes while they were trying to listen to a song by Jordan Feliz :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got the show only because of the discount offered at the time and I like the things that it can do however the only feature of the show over the other echo products is the screen and the ability to see other family members when talking etc. however you have to get the other family members to have the show in order to communicate. Duh? So as far as features the show doesn't have anything more than the cheaper echo products have. The setting up of the extended home feature was not as easy as originally advertised, one has to be pretty tech savy to get the devices to work. Nice once working but a little over marketed in my opinion. The sound is great when playing music and you will enjoy that, but you have to download a lot of things to your devices to get other features of ""Alexa's"" capabilities. I don't like overloading my phone with useless icons so I did not like that feature of the echo at all.

The audio is good, but I have to say the the omnidirectional sound of our original echos is much better for us. Seems to fill the room better with sound. I do like the screen integration with the Ring video doorbell that I have seen, but we don't have a Ring, so I don't get that payoff. I think they should open up the platform more to developers to do more innovative apps and services that fully utilize the platform.

As luck would it have when Amazon had their prime day a couple of months ago the Echo Show was reduced to $129 so I thought I would take the plunge and purchase it.  Both my wife and I are really enjoying this device even though we have only minimally tapped into all of its functions.  The main thing we use it for is the 2 million plus songs that are available through the prime membership.  I plan on purchasing a blue tooth speaker so we can listen to music while sitting on the patio.  Another feature we use it for quite frequently is the timer function.  It's definitely more convenient to simply tell Alexa to set a timer for a specific period of time instead of using the microwave.  We also use it for spelling of words and definitions occasionally.  I also just purchased a smart plug for approximately $10 and now have Alexa enabled voice activated on/off switch, and yesterday I purchased two more smart plugs.  The other thing that I really am happy with is having the 7 inch screen on the Echo Show.  I enjoy looking at the lyrics of songs that I have difficulty understanding, at times, and now can actually see what the lyrics are.  I also synced my android phone contact list with Alexa so I can make and receive calls through Alexa.  So, I've just touched the surface of what Alexa can do and am really enjoying it.  I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys new electronic devices.  On another note,  Alexa is definitely useful for all ages and is very easy to set up!  Great job with this device Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We video conference this way a couple of times a day, and it's done wonders for her spirit. She's able to video conference from her show to our smart phone. She is thankful for little things using Alexa like asking what time it is without having to get up out of bed. She's lost some mobility due to a stroke, so anything that makes her life easier is worth it to me.

Pros: Good sound. I often stream Sling TV from my Fire Tablet with the sound coming from my Echo Show, which is room filling.
Neighbors doing 7am yardwork? I ask from bed for Alexa to play nature music and the speakers are loud enough for a leaf blower to be a distant hum.
I am obesessed with my the cuteness of my dog. Every time I snap (another) cell phone pic of him I instantly load it as my Show's background. (Too which my husband eye rolls.)
Songs having lyrics scroll on the screen is fun, I look up when Im at a part in a song that Ive always wondered what the singer was saying.
Asking Alexa about the weather and seeing the numbers and littles suns or clouds, unecessary but I love it.
I really havent found a use for the camera feature yet but it does take a hands free picture.
I havent made video calls yet. Wanted to get my son an Echo Spot for Christmas and to try that feature out.
Cons:
The ask Alexa tips that constantly appear on the bottom of the screen drive my husband batty. I have had fire tablets for many years so I guess ads and tips dont bother me. You NEVER see anything while she is doing tasks for you of course.
The show is much bulkier than I thought. Originally I intended to place it on the bed when I wanted to stream prime but I just leave it on the night stand and connect it to my tablet.
Amazon reeally needs to get Youtube back. Id love to steam HowTos and DIYs from my Show.

I unpacked it just under 24 hours ago, and had the day off to get acquainted with it. The speaker system is just as good as the original Echo, plus on many tracks, synced lyrics are shown. Stories span the screen throughout the day, and you have the option to tap the screen to see a video of the story. The first one I saw was of a spider casting a 50 foot web.

The time is displayed unless you're in the middle of another task, so when I'm in the room with the show, I don't have to ask the time. The screen also gives real time outdoor temperature. Some Networks offer a video option to the Flash Briefing. Also today, I discovered that my favorite News Network, OANN, has an app that allows me to listen to their Newscast live, which is great.

I have yet to try making or receiving video calls, as it appears none of my contacts have even the Alexa APP. The home screen has a scrolling wallpaper effect, and you can also customize it. I've got a lot of discovering to do yet with the Show, but it is a welcome edition to my collection of Alexa Enabled Devices.

Only suggestion I have so far would be that, given the Show does have a screen and a motion sensor, Alexa be given a virtual face for active conversations. I'm no programmer, but with the sensor, Alexa should even be able to follow the user, turning her head as whoever is talking to her moves.

...One week later... The Echo Show has yet to disappoint. Over the past few days I've had the opportunity to try the Video Calling and Drop-in features. They work great, and it was pretty cool to be away from home and drop-in on my Echo Show, seeing that all was just as I had left it. Now I just need to convince other people I know to al least install the Alexa App. The coolest part is that as long as you have Wi-Fi, your phone doesn't need to have a service plan, as calls are placed via the Alexa App. I installed a Google Voice # on an old phone of mine, installed the Alexa App under a separate Amazon account, and am now able to make calls with that phone to and from my current phone and Echo devices. Going back to the Drop-In feature now, I believe a great addition to that would be what I consider a ""Show-Me"" feature. Using ""Show-Me"" would enable the user to access the camera-feed of the Echo Show from their phone or another Echo Show, without the screen waking up. Renters have to deal with Landlords who sometimes allow their workers into the premises unbeknownst to  the renter. The ability to watch your home, without someone who lives there knowing you are watching, via your Echo Show through your Smart phone, would be awesome.

A few other features I have stumbled across are that, beyond the camera/mic off button, the camera can be turned off separately using the ""Do Not Disturb"" feature. Either ask Alexa, use the pull down menu on-screen, or use the Alexa App to accomplish this. While ""Do Not Disturb"" is active, the ""Drop-In"" feature is disabled. Also, tell Alexa to ""Turn off your screen"" will stop the advertisements from scrolling across the screen and leave only a clock, which moves every few minutes. The illumination of the clock is controlled via the bright/dim feature on the pull down menu.

2nd Edit: Going back to the ""Show Me"" feature that I think would be quite helpful (not that I'd expect that's what it would be called), it seems that since the Echo Show does have a motion sensor, that would be quite useful in a private Drop-In security feature. Assuming there is no one home, and no pets are in the house, one should theoretically be able to set an alert, based on the motion sensor, that will instantly notify the Smart phone of the primary user, or any household member selected, that something is happening that should not be. That notification, once received, could allow the respondent to give their Smart phone a command such as ""Alexa, Show Me"", and immediately see what is happening while the Show remains silent, while in no way alerting any potential intruder, except perhaps, Alexa's eventual face staring them down. Then, if needed, the user could call the police and give the intruder a welcoming farewell surprise. The Echo Show could potentially be the perfect silent alarm, giving one the option to see what's happening before the police are called for what could possibly be no reason at all. Makes me wish computer programming made any sense whatsoever to me.

Something else I recently discovered is that while the Alexa App on your Smart phone will import any contacts who also have the Alexa App on their Smart phone, you do have the option of blocking any of them whom you do not wish to communicate with via the Alexa App. The App is also helpful in giving yourself a reminder when get home. Just send yourself a text or voice message through the App if you have something you may need to take care of but may forget otherwise. The yellow lights will be active on the Echo, and the Show will have the number of messages illuminated in the conversation symbol.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

She still uses a slider phone with no video capabilities and the drop in feature has amazing call and video quality. At first I started using the video capabilities by standing or sitting next to the Echo Show and it was a hassle  to move it to catch all the things the grandchildren wanted to show grandma (their cartwheels, summersualt, you’d, etc.). Then I discovered the Alexa app on my iPhone and the drop in feature is like FaceTiming (WIFI and LTE) with my mom on her Echo Show. The picture quality and sound was great, but i think this will vary depending on the reception you get and your high speed internet package. There are a lot of apps like Facebook and WhatsApp that have these video calling capabilities but again my mom doesn’t have a smartphone and this Echo Show was the perfect solution for us. I also bought her a 4K Sony TV that works with Alexa but it didn’t have as many features as I hoped. My mom can control the TV with the basic functions such as turning on or off the TV, turning volume up or down with the Echo Show.

My children love talking to Alexa through the Echo Show. We create a playlist for each individual house member and Alexa will play their playlist for them to have a dance party before bed or use it for waking them up. The only drawback about the playlists, it is very slow to skip through songs toward the bottom of your playlist. Another cool feature is playing the music on all Echo devises in your home. I wish Amazon Music Unlimited allowed the Echo Show to play two different songs at once as a single user. The only way of doing this is by purchadi the family plan and signing in as a different user for each Echo Show. Another way is by using Amazon Music on one device and Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc. on another device.

The multiple timer feature with Alexa works amazing. Way better then Siri. My wife uses it when she cooks, I use it when I grill, we use it when someone needs to take a time out or how much time someone has to finish up cleaning their rooms or floor messes.

We use the Echo Show for White Noise. The problem with this is that Amazon sends updated to your Echo Show automatically and when they do, it resets the Apps you use during that time. Therefore the White Noise will stop working.

We also have the Ring product. It does work on the Echo Show but you can only see who is at the front door and you can’t have a 2 way communication. Hopefully this will change in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amazon marketed this device heavily around video content, specifically YouTube.  Then it lost the ability to access YouTube.  I understand that this was Google’s decision but Amazon should have had an agreement in place to prevent this from happening.  I don’t like spending $230 on something that only works slightly better than other devices I own and living with the risk that at any time it can lose features.

Beyond that, it’s an Echo.  Works great for controlling smart home devices.  Certainly wouldn’t pay $230 again for this knowing what I know now.  I called and complain and they finally offered me a partial refund.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_259?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=259&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Audio could be better. Great video chat/Ring connectivity.","September 16, 2018","I happened to stumble upon this little gem at a Treasure Truck at a price that I couldn’t pass up and glad I got it. It’s a great piece and love the pictures and videos that it can “show” (pun intended). I knew about the issues with YouTube and am still upset over the fact that this can’t display YouTube videos. There is a work around, but it’s just not worth the trouble. YouTube was one of the selling points of this product and after it was taken away, I felt like I was misguided since the reason to buy this was to easily look up YouTube videos.

Albeit that is no longer an option, I do like the fact that I can view my Ring cameras on this device when you link your Ring account via the Alexa app. Another great feature is the video calling. My family also has a Show and love how I can call them on and video chat with them. In their case, their Show is not on a lower table, so they have to angle the device down to see them better. Maybe have an adjustable camera for the next gen?

Another neat feature is that you can almost use this as a security camera to keep tabs on your own house by dropping in and making sure everything is fine.

Besides the YouTube issue, I was not impressed with the audio quality at all. It’s definitely deeper than the first gen Echo, but it is not as clear. Of all of the Echo devices, the first gen is the staple when it comes to audio quality. Unless you have an Echo Dot connected to an external audio source, and you’re an audiophile, the first was the best. I think that all Echo devices should have Aux out capability as well as dual Bluetooth. I really like how I can use Multi-Room music across all (4 total) Echo devices, but I cannot connect my phone to any of them and then have them also connect with Multi-Room music. I can only use the radio/audio features built into Alexa.

Overall, it’s a great product, but keep an eye out for Treasure Truck deals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Its inconsistency is the only consistency. While the Echo which this replaced heard us just fine (and still does), the Show does not. The quality of the audio is not any better than the 1st gen echo.

While the audio initially worked fine, I was disappointed with the ""smart"" features of the system. For example, devices can only be a part of one single group. If you want a device in a group called ""downstairs"", but also want it in a separate group called ""Livingroom"", you can't do it. It's one group of or the other.

Also, if you say ""Alexa, turn to CNN"", there is a strong chance an Alexa device (not the Fire TV Cube) will answer and tell you that it does not know how to handle the command.

OK, so these can be semi-dismissed as minor flaws or growing pains as Alexa matures...

But with every update, the streaming audio capability of these devices worsens. A few weeks ago the echoes with a display started showing the incorrect song playing. And with the latest update, the devices are simply going silent in the middle of songs. To get audio again, you either have to skip the current song or pause then play it to hear any audio. It's honestly rendered the units useless to the point I've taken them out of groups and rely solely on my Sonos speakers.

Support has been non-existent except to deny there is an issue while simultaneously saying there will be an update. You can talk to two people in a row and they will tell you completely different things.

I spent several hundred dollars on these devices and I am honestly ready to drop them off at Goodwill. If you are buying these devices to listen to music in your home, they are absolutely worthless. You cannot even listen to a single song without manually pausing/re-starting every 20-30 seconds.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I really wanted to love the Echo Show, the software for the Echo Show needs a lot more development and is lacking basic functionality.(DEV TEAM-This is just constructive criticism)
I've been doing everything Alexa does(except for Smart home Automation) on my Windows PC for the past 12 years with Microsoft Speech Recognition  and WSR Macros along with VBS scripts to make the computer respond with voice...
There are things I have found useful,
Pros
1. control smart home devices via voice,
2.playing music (the sound quality is just ok for the price)(Only while connected to the internet---------)
3.Timers.
The Cons are numerous though
 Cons
1.Always online- no offline functionality what so ever
2.Finding useful skills has been impossible for me.
3.The screen is not used often enough to justify having one,it needs a skill to find and browse skills to be developed.....
3.It needs a usable web browser to be developed or unlock the one already hidden in the settings.
4. Alexa isn't an A.I., if it is,then it seems to be an extremely soft A.I.
5.  needs more customization settings-I.E. ability to choose or block news sources which show on the home screen.
6. Alexa  misunderstands often
7.Barge-In  needs improvement
8. has no Anaphora Resolution, needs developed
 I got a second Show for my Kitchen so I could view recipes while cooking only to find that every skill I tried had way too many flaws to be useful.
 I still have to use my phone,Laptop or tablet to view recipes.
 I do have the ability and knowledge to code skills, I won't since Alexa is cloud based and uses an API.
 I plan on installing OpenHAB and using raspberry-pi with the internals out of the two echo shows to build a better device for my own use which would make a web server or cloud service optional for Home Automation,
 The biggest reason is because it will ALWAYS work on my Intranet if the Internet is disconnected or down and will still play Music/Movies/T.v. that I have already bought over the past 20 years from my Home Plex server.
 I did get a call from Amazon Support which was more of a waste of time than helpful.
I think The Echo Show has too much wasted potential and will never live up to the potential I know it has built in.
I do appreciate that Amazon has not stuck us with Ads on the Echo Show.
I will update periodically and am hoping for the development of better software and useful Skills.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Use it in conjunction with our other smart products (ring doorbell, smarthings hub) and they work well together.  The sound is also great and love that the words to the song shows up on the screen.
The one draw back I have is the sound recognition isn't as great. We replaced our first generation Echo with this Show and it doesn't pick up our commands across the room as well as the Echo.

I already had an Echo Dot and recently bought the Sonos One.  I used the Dot to listen to a Flash Briefing at bedtime, and to run my bedroom lamp off a small WeMo plug (and my lamp became my bedroom fan during the summer).
The Show was easy to set up, the Dot moved into the kitchen, and now can play ""Music Everywhere"".  The screen is small, but on my bedside table, I was able find Doctor Who episodes and watch a bit right before bedtime.  I also found some yoga videos on Amazon Prime which I shall find useful.

Why doesn't the Show have 5 stars?  Not enough video skills.  Here's a wish list:
I would like to enable the skill for say, CNN or MSNBC (or even better, Jake Tapper or Rachel Maddow), have it show me a group of recent clips, and I can say ""Show me Clip # 3"", to watch like video podcasts.  The CNN headlines available for Flash Briefing were pretty useless.
I'm surprised Amazon hasn't enabled a good selection of themes and background slide-shows, or encouraged third-parties to develop the same.  This time of year, I'd love a Tropical Island slide-show :)
There are excellent sources for music video besides Youtube.  VuHaus and NPR Music have wonderful selections.  What about an NPR Tiny Desk skill?
If I stop watching a Prime Video, it would be nice to come back the next night and say ""Alexa, resume Doctor Who"" and pick up where I left off.

Based on the other Amazon Echo products, I expect the Show to be far more useful a year from now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_113?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=113&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This seems like a product built for a kitchen. It would be nice if you could browse the internet for recipes, or save them. Likewise maybe create a shopping list and print it. Watch movies on Netflix or Hulu, but it does none of those things.

Initially we kind of struggled to find practical uses for it but after a few days it became evident that with a little effort you can do alot.

Security cameras - if your cameras support RTSP then you can use Monocle skill to set up all your non-alexa enabled camera easily. ""Alexa, show me the front door"" and I'm looking at the front door. Now this skill is still beta I believe so about once a week or two it won't work as the service is down for a short period, but given that accessing the feeds this way is far faster than opening any phone based apps, I'd call it a win. My wife recently had twins so that makes this feature even more useful since we get alot of solicitors who love to annoy homeowners in the area.

Drop in - each of my kids have a Dot, a Echo in the bedroom, a dot in the guest room, and a dot in the basement. So using drop in is really handy to tell someone somewhere in the house something.

Announce - you can broadcast a message to all other exho devices in the house with this simple command. This is great for gathering the family for dinner time.

Random news stories - the device scrolls different news stories across the screen throughout the day along with the command to hear more about this particular story, such as ""Try 'Alexa, what's the whale story' "". If you want to hear the story about a new pod of whales that the headline above mentioned.

Camera - This has been alot of fun to be honest. With a variety of stickers you can take selfies with different art superimposed such as a mustache or silly hat.

Custom Skills - With Amazon's ""Skill Blueprint"" feature it has not become ridiculously easy to built your own custom Skills. I created one based on the house guests blue print where you list off different things a guest may want to locate or ask how to do along with the answers and boom, now visitors know where to find TP, plungers, silverware, plates, bowels, fire extinguisher, remote controls, bathrooms, change inputs on the TV, turn the theater on and off, password for the WiFi...and so on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My father's contact has the long version of his first name, and a middle initial so in order to call him I literally have to say something like ""Call Charles G. Johnson"" instead of ""Call Dad"". I wish Alexa could support nick names for contacts to make it easier / more natural to call people we know. Honestly, there are people that show up in my contacts that I will NEVER call using Alexa. That is a worthless feature to me. However, using nick names is a big deal. The drop in feature works really well but my wife won't allow us to have it turned on because she thinks its creepy. I think if there is a better way to tell if somebody is watching / dropped in that would be nice. Also, it would be nice if the privacy setting allowed to block drop ins ONLY but allow calls to come through. That way you could leave drop in enabled and only disable it at certain times. Also it would be nice if you could set 'office hours' for drop in.

The Nucleus has always had sound quality issues and the picture quality is always hit or miss and usually ends up freezing within seconds of being into a conversation. That doesn’t happen on the Echo Show. Also bekng able to use Alexa for any questions or managing any of my other smart devices is a plus....being able to ask it to show me my Ring Doorbell and any one of my Arlo Cameras is FANTASTIC!  We also have become accustomed to listening to Pandora through it while we are cooking.  Just an all around good device...and I’m looking forward to trying out the 2nd gen very soon.

Basically a stationary version if Siri. It is nice to have a screen with an Alexa product, but at the time of this review, Youtube won’t function with it. This makes it severely limited. I have Amazon Prime video, but not a ton of content on there. Its nice being able to watch my Amazon stuff on the Echo Show, but I can’t watch Netflix or Youtube. Also, it can’t work without a corded connection to a power outlet, so for music I still use my Bose speaker in the other part of the house.

Its really nice for video calling family/friends, but they have to have an Echo Show as well. There’s a lot of features and things they keep adding to this device though, so I might get more out of it as time goes on.

I’ll end on a positive: the Amazon music feature is really cool. For $3 a month, you have unlimited music with the Amazon Music option. Any song any time. You only get this access on the Echo show, but that’s so cheap. It makes for a fun way to let everyone play around with the music for a party by just yelling “Alexa, play ____!”

Highly recommeded for peoplemwho’d rather say “Alexa, tell me the weather forecast” than check an app on their phone. The music feature is cool. And if you’ve invested a lot in Prime Video already, this will make a lot of sense for you.  If you already play on your phone a lot, and don’t know anyone with an Echo Show, then I’d hold off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Instead of placing another review which many people have done already let me post some good ideas for software upgrades.  At the bottom of the screen where Alexa places the usual color bar that used to be the colored rings on the original.  A software upgrade would be nice where if you have a missed message instead of the right hand corner icon make the line at the bottom of the screen blink green like the top ring does on the original.  For a missed call maybe another color on the bottom and a third color for missed call and message.  Another possible upgrade would be for anyone having more than 2, or even for more than 2 with friends and family the ability to have a party type call where the screen would then have half size or quarter size pictures instead of the full screen for a party or 3 way call. Also for anyone having the Alexa show and echo when a call is made to the show a ring audible to the original echo in case you are in a different room.  The messages now go to both, no reason the ring shouldn't, just some ideas.. A slide shutter for the camera might be nice instead of shutting the camera or blocking it with something so you can keep drop in enabled on the show.  It's new and I know it will evolve.

For example, I cannot seem to find a simple command for Echo to tell me what my Honeywell thermostat is set to,  I can change it up and down, it just won't report the current setting.  Also I have Shows in multiple homes, need a better way to delineate which devices go with which location.  For example, when in location ""1"" and I want to change the temperature, it should default to the thermostat co=located with the Show device I am speaking to.  Then it could require more specific instructions if I want to change the thermostat in the other location.

Also, integration with Ring cameras is sporadic at best.  Sometime it shows them, sometimes it doesn't, even when the Ring App itself is able to show them.

In addition, I would expect to be able to have more customization available for the Home Screen such as showing the current date along with weather conditions and forecast.  It is a ""Show"".

We bought 2 as I have a 2 story house and one of us is upstair in the computer filming studio working most evenings and I am down stairs after dinner usually working on my computer while listening to an audio book. We have it set up as a video phono and when Jon calls me to ask a question, my audible book pauses and the Show lets me verbally answer him. I can see his face while we talk which I love. Years ago Disney had a special pavilion of future predicted devices and video phones was one of them. This is so much better because I do not want to be on video most of the time with other people and have never been a fan of skype. I think we are using this like our own voice activated  walkie talkie with a picture and it will let me leave a voice message without having to do it from my Iphone.  I have 3 other echo devices in the house and this is my favorite.
We will probably discover more stuff to use it for but if that is all it did I would be very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. It HAS A SCREEN people!! A GORGEOUS screen.. i mean WHY have a virtual assistant that you can only yap at??
2. INCREDIBLE SOUND 🔊 from it's two front firing speakers 🔊, deep bass with rich highs and perfect midrange.
3. Totally modern, modular, classy design.. i recommend the WHITE color. STYLE CITY 😎
4. SUPERB engineering.. built to last, i mean this baby is HEFTY, but in a good way.
5. They even thought of putting a rubber pad on the bottom to prevent it slipping off  your table, nightstand, etc.
6. The ' drop in' feature is probably a great idea for ppl who have ppl that have one also so you can video chat, i myself will never use it and being paranoid as i am, I put a piece of tape over it's camera. 😱😵
7. You CAN change the query command if you don't feature saying ""Alexa"" every time, which is intuitive.. especially if you maybe have an EX wife with that name, lol 😂.
8. Amazon claims they will always be adding new features and updates to the device and i feel they WILL cuz of course they strive to keep customers happy but also they wanna move these units like hotcakes!

So, this is MY input on the ECHO SHOW and i hope it might help you decide easier.
Why talk to a tinny sounding hockey puck when you can have a handsome mini TV / virtual friend in your house? 😉

The screen resolution is great and the sound is even better.  The sound quality is a HUGE improvement over my Echo Spot even with the speaker I bought to go with it.  BUT, it does not pick up my voice as well as my two Echo Spots.  Sometimes I have to tell it to stop and then start over several times with my instructions.  My biggest complaint is that after watching several videos it locks up.  If I unplug it and plug it back in it doesn't freeze up again for a while...but then I have to do it again.  It is as if it has a cache that gets full and has to be cleared.  Also, I thought I could get Netflix on it but apparently not...or maybe I just don't know how to get to it.  Another aggravation is for video series with several seasons (for example Frasier) it won't automatically pick up from the last video I watched.  Every time I have to tell it which season.  I've gone back to using my iPad to watch videos.  Maybe this is why Amazon cut the price so much.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought two, so that I could put one at my mom's house as she has early onset Alzheimer's. It's nice to be able to 'Drop In' on her to check on her, even though there is always someone around. Video quality is pretty nice but I'm sure it depends on your up/down speeds.
Hopefully they will add a way to monitor your home with the cameras without using 'Drop In' but rather somehow clandestinely, so that it doesn't beep to alert someone that your watching, this way you could check on baby/dog sitters without them knowing.
The interface is intuitive, and it's nice to play games like 'Jeopardy' and now be able to see the clues, etc. on the screen.
The design is a little rushed it seems, as it would have been nice to be able to move the camera or even wall mount the unit, which would be awkward given the shape of the back the way it is now.
I have every Echo device that was made except for the 'Tap' and really like them.

My elderly parent is not used to portable land line phones (and was forgetting to hang up the line), so the Show works really well. No numbers to dial. She talks to the machine and it does what she tells it to do.

She initially didn't want video calling, but she loves seeing the caller!! Seems to view it as a talking TV!

It's also really great to check on how she looks that day. I can see the room she is calling from and whether things are in order or whether an aide needs to fix something.

The set-up however was very difficult. I live outside the US, have a foreign SIM card, and the Show app was not available where I live. Also, my mom does not have a US smartphone. Had to hire a techie to set up the machines where she lives and then I carried mine back on the plane.

What I like the most is the quality of the video chat, we have several Echo Spots in the house and it's a lot of fun to drop in on other family members, the sound quality is crystal clear and the video quality is outstanding!!
About dropping in, you can add Echo Spots or Echo Shows to your ""household"" in settings or you can choose from your contacts BUT the other person would have to give permission first, so no need to be worried that someone unexpected might drop in on you. Also, there is a sound when someone drops in on you and it will take about 10-15 seconds for the other person to be able to see you which gives you time to make yourself presentable. ;)

We put the Echo Show in our kitchen which is very entertaining. You can ask it for recipes, play music, add stuff to your shopping list, video chat with family members or watch a movie.

Eventually I would anticipate the ability to cast this to a larger TV screen so that mom will be able to see far away family members as though they were in the room with her.

Well, this product is good for you then. I ask it plenty of questions and Alexa doesn't know that. Asking it factual questions is hit or miss.
Great at ordering Amazon things, but for the price its just hands free and Blah..but still has issues with that.
You could be having a conversation and say something and you know who tries to interrupt. My experience is 3 out of 5. Definitely needs to work Alexa out for better automation. Its a great ride at the beginning, but then becomes annoying when you have to buy everything to keep her going, like Music unlimited and whatever else you want her to do.
Great screen and customizable and sound is great, but lacks base for the sound guru's.

Best part of Alexa is telling her to sound like a sheep. Who comes up with this stuff.

Super excellent packaging.  Shows a great deal of thought and creativity went into packaging.  Shows class and quality.  Haven’t hooked up yet so can’t give true evaluation until later.  Product appearance looks well made and of high quality.  My only real complaint is that I ordered it in white to match a new kitchen being remodeled.  The echo show body is white and looks great but the adapter and power cord are black.  This will stand out and be obtrusive in my new white kitchen.  This should have been peered with a white adapter/cable.  At the same time that I ordered the show I ordered an echo plus in white.  The echo plus looks great and matches the white adapter and cable supplied with the unit.  I compared the white adapter cable/cord with the black adapter cable/cord and except for the color they look identical and are both rated at 21 W.

They are all ho hum.  This one is no exception.  Alexa is just not smart enough, and is too Amazon specific.  Ask Alexa common knowledge and she can give the wrong information.  Not just about things, I think she is wrong on, but on simple a geographic quiz.

Things that need to improve about Alexa:
1.) She/It needs to be better at finding information that the general internet can find.  If I can figure it out with Google, Duck Duck Go, or Bing.  She/It should be able to do it well.
2.) She/It needs to understand exceptions to the rules.  If I say that I want to have an Alarm at 5:30 every weekday, but not on the first of the year, good luck figuring that out.
3.) She/It needs to accept keyboard input from bluetooth enabled keyboards.
4.) Don't forget about mouse support.

Along with the confusions of Alexa.  There is the utter confusion about the Amazon Alexa App used to configure it.  How many ways do I have to configure the thing to keep purchases, even free purchases, from happening without my password.  Also, why on a screen enabled device do I need to go to a different app to do security.

On the plus side though, at least it finally has a web browser working since Amazon had that spat with YouTube/Google, they decided to make the system more functional.

Since this is a Linux system, I should have access to the terminal please.  I want my compiler and to run Docker and such while it sucks power otherwise idle.

Oh, and the screen turns on whenever doing voice input.  I'd much rather have ""Alexa, turn screen on.""  By doing that, I could actually keep the brightness down.

Sound quality is grand, but don't think Amazon is making this device for you.  They are making it to keep you in their ecosystem.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's easy to see timers/alarms on the screen without having to ask.  The picture/slide show is nice.  Also, the constant little reminders of ways to interact with Alexa on the screen subtly helps train you in terms of it's possible uses.  Overall a great value!

The sound is as good as the ECHO 2 and way better than the Spot and the Dot. The microphone it uses to pick up your voice commands is not good. At times I have to really raise my voice even in a quiet room. Now I am comparing that to the ECHO 2 and Spot which obviously have better 360 microphones. The camera is ok not great but not bad quality picture. The thing I'll warn you about is the camera has a slight upward angle so if you are planning on placing it on a high dresser or elevated shelf be aware that it will be looking at the ceiling and not straight. It's good in a bedroom as a ""drop in"" doesn't show your bed.... but if you want to video chat you'll need to keep it on a lower shelf and probably be standing or very close up to it.  Not really a negative but just a heads up for those in the market.

 Besides the poor quality microphone the only other complaint is the inability to use this as a realistic clock. The number display is small. I wish there was a setting to make the clock the ENTIRE face of the show at scheduled times like between 8pm-7am. The rest of the day it can scroll the headlines ect... but at night I would like a larger number clock function","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_299?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=299&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Roses","Limited benefits, many caveats","June 7, 2018","I've had the echo show since day 1 and I think it is time to leave a review.

TL;DR

Buy it if:
-You want to frequently video call family
-Are cost conscious and subscribe to Prime Music

Do not buy if:
-You got some more money to spend and don't mind spending
-Won't Video Call
-You care deeply about user experience and music quality
-Are deep in the Apple ecosystem

As I obviously cannot return this anymore, I will be selling the two I bought on eBay. There are just no reasons to own this over other options. I know this may not be a popular opinion, but for those of us willing to pay more for a much better experience, owning an Apple HomePod has really show me how much I hate my Echo. Obviously the sound quality is far greater on the HomePod, but it should given the price difference. However, the kicker is the voice recognition. I use Echo mostly to turn my lights and equipment on and off. The Echo RARELY understand me the first time, no matter how quiet the room is and how clearly I speak. It will NOT hear you if there is any decent amount of background noise. It is FRUSTRATING and kills the usability. I can literally WHISPER with HomePod playing music full blast and it hears me no problem. To me, this is everything.

The screen, while novel is useful in only very limited situations. I will say, if you plan on video calling family, it is a no brainer to own one, especially at $150. Outside of that, and maybe the cute weather animations you can call up, I never use the screen. I was super excited when this device came out and replaced 2 standard Echos on day one. I just have not seen anything much of value come out since then.

The software is extremely lacking. Setting up devices and managing smart home functions frankly sucks. With the R&D budget Amazon has, it is quite embarrassing what they have designed here. The nail in the coffin is the lack of integration with YouTube and Apple Music, which is a killer for me. I do not want Prime Music and will never sign up for it, so I cannot listen to my music on this thing.

Additional note 1, processing user requests happens on the cloud. While not terribly slow, there is a noticeable lag when compared to a device like the HomePod which has an onboard processor.

Additional note 2, because processing is not done on the device, privacy and security are not as tight as many users might want. For further reading, google Apple's stance on user privacy, their insistence on maintaining it and why they do processing on board.

Pros-
-Has a screen, looking at weather and setting up a video call are easy and helpful
-Current Price. At $230 MSRP, it is overpriced for what it can do, at the current promo price of $150, worth it over a regular Echo

Cons-
-MICROPHONES ARE AWFUL - There might be 7 of them, but they were definitely made in China. I can be in a silent room and speak to Echo loudly and clearly and rarely does it understand me the first time, or the second..... absolutely frustrating. If there is any background noise or you ever watch TV, don't even bother
-Lack of useful apps for the screen. There just not much to use it for
-Lack of connectivity. Does not work with Apple Music or YouTube, 'nuff said
-Sound Quality. Just does not do a good enough job on music for me to use it, ever.
-Sluggish to react","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After writing my original review I was contacted by amazon within minutes. They attempted to resolve my issue over the phone and when that didn’t work had me send it in. Well, the “new” one flickers too. Not sure if it’s a new device, a refurbished one or the same one I had before but it’s the same problem. Screen flickers and completely ruins the experience. Maybe they fixed this in version 2 but for the original I’m not impressed. Avoid at all costs not worth it.

Maybe I could forgive the fact that echo frequently doesn’t know the answer to my question or that the interface is too hard to browse the movies I own verbally but what’s unforgivable is the screen is already starting to go out after very light use. Things I like are being able to see my multiple timers at once, the fact that it’s touch screen and that the speaker is powerful. However without the screen what’s the point of paying this much.

We have an Echo Dot in every room of our house, including the kids’ rooms, as well as a Fire TV. Alexa feels like part of the family. I got most of our Dots on sale or through warehouse deals, so we hardly paid more than $35 for any of them. The price tag of the Show, combined with the mixed reviews, had me hesitant to buy. I also really wanted the Show to replace the digital photo frame I had in my kitchen, and many reviews seemed to suggest it failed in that task.

The week before Prime Day 2018, I saw that the Show had a great sale price. Even better, I found one through a warehouse deal for $95! AND we had points on our Amazon Visa that covered even more of the cost. I got my Show for barely more than I paid for a Dot!

My family and I love it!!! The image on the screen is much clearer than I expected. My daughter loves having a movie playing while she does her chores in the kitchen. So far, Alexa understands our commands just as well as on our Dots. The sound clarity is fine for us on movies and music. An audiophile might find it lacking, but the average listener like us would be happy. The volume is also much louder than the Dots, which we appreciate.

I’m thrilled that the Show has replaced my digital photo frame quite nicely. It even feels like an upgrade there!  I was already a user of Amazon photos ... that is a key component here. On Photos from my computer, I created an album called Screensaver. I put about 300 favorite photos in there. In the Show’s settings, I chose this album as the background source, and set the Show to rotate through these. It chooses a new one every 10 minutes or so. The photo is somewhat in shadow in the background, but clear enough to see. Overplayed are the time, the temp, and the “things to try” sentence. I wish the last one wasn’t there but I can deal with it. When I want the Show to become a true digital photo frame, I ask Alexa to show my screensaver album. It gives the option to shuffle the photos and to play on a loop. The photos display bright and clear (moreso than my previous frame), changing every few seconds. The time/temp/try text disappears. I love that vertical images aren’t cut off to fit the landscape frame. The full vertical image displays with a self-background. The photo loop plays until I tell it to stop or give a new command. I’ve had it running for hours. With Amazon photos, it’s a breeze to add or remove images in the album. I can even ask Alexa to show vacation photos, or photos of my dogs, or photos from a specific year or of a specific person.

I want another Show for my office! I don’t know that I can justify the full $200+ price tag, but if I find another great warehouse deal or save up enough visa points, I’ll jump on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Alexa tells me the weather, the traffic report, gives me information when I ask, helps my daughter with her homework, and plays music and videos. The drop-in feature alone is worth the price. When my daughter is alone in the house, I can drop in on her and chat face-to-face. She texts me when she leaves the school bus, and I drop in so I am “home” when she comes in the door, even though I am at work. That relives her anxiety about coming into an empty house (except for the dogs).  This device is wonderful for anyone who has kids who might be alone, or older parents who might need some supervision when you are not there. The drop in feature sends a sound so the party knows you are dropping in, and you don’t get to actually see the room for ten seconds, giving the other party a chance to decline the drop in (So no stealthy spying with this device).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Okamuro","Worth a look when discounted....","July 20, 2018","It's safe to say that I've bought in to the Alexa ecosystem (2 Taps, 5 Echos, and 7 Echo Dots, and several Fire Sticks/Fire TV).  Most of those acquisitions were made on previous Prime days or during refurb sales, because the cost of the better devices can be off putting when outfitting your entire home.  While I've had a passing interest in the Show since it came out, I really wasn't motivated to buy it at MSRP.  I broke down and picked up an Echo Show, heavily discounted, on Prime Day.

This is probably the time to let you know what kind of Alexa user I am..  I'd rate myself about a 7/10 in general usage.  I have various skills tied into Alexa (home automation, various music services, etc.), but I'm not the best user of Amazon's services.  I ask for the daily news briefing, the traffic, and the weather forecast.  I add items to lists, set alarms, timers, reminders, events, etc.  However, I do not order anything, utilize daily deals, ask for jokes, or anything else really.

As a hardware device, the Show appears to be pretty solid.  I would not describe it as particularly attractive, but that's subjective.  The sound quality is roughly on par with a regular Echo, which is to say ok, but not excellent.  The touchscreen is responsive and well-lit.  On the negative side, the viewing angle is not particularly wide.  Unlike a tablet or smartphone, this type of device is going to be fairly static in its placement, so the relatively narrow viewing angle is not ideal.  The voice recognition and microphone pickup range do not appear to be diminished from a regular Echo.  I wasn't sure if the audio pickup was going to become more directional, but informal testing indicates that it's not very directional... off-axis recognition is pretty good.

As far as the interface of the device, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I hoped that it wasn't just a combo of an Echo and the Alexa app that's on my phone (essentially merging them on one device).  Fortunately, this is not the case.  The screen continually rolls headlines and command suggestions, while displaying a clock.  This display brightness is tied to the ambient light.  Since my Show is in my kitchen, the most useful benefit is being able to see my various cooking timers. The display also shows search results, music cover art, photos, etc.

If you're primary use case for the device is video calling, it does the task well.  The main question would be if the value proposition of the device is high enough to make it a good alternative to an Echo with a tablet or smartphone.  The lack of portability and high cost (when not discounted) are considerable cons - I would say it would be 2 or 3 stars at the normal retail price.  However, at the heavily discounted Prime Day price, it's a good alternative to a regular Echo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But to be honest, I do not love it. I was disappointed with YouTube not being available. After reading many reviews, apparently it wasn't there, then it was there, and now, its not there again. I am holding out hopes that whatever the problem is, it will get resolved. The sound quality is absolutely amazing, I thought the regular echo was great, the show blows it out of the water. There are so many benefits to the show above all other echo products. Being able to see movie trailers, Amazon Prime videos, calendars, shopping lists, are all great. The video calling, and the drop in feature is also great! I really like that I can drop in on my show while I am at work, to check on the dogs, or my teenagers when they are there alone.

The screen has a burnt image of the home screen shadow on it that you can see when doing other activities to it. She can’t differentiate between a song title or genre very well.
It works for what I got it for. The audio speakers are decent and can be heard a good space away. The responsiveness to voice alert is a little weak. I will sometimes have to speak louder than normal for it to wake up. I have used it to connect to my ring doorbell as well as wifi cameras I have at home; it took a bit for the cameras. It easily makes calls to other people, however it doesn't alert you to incoming calls from non-alexa devices. Would like to see that as an improve. The video quality in vid-calls is decent.

All.","July 21, 2017","I love the echo family...I have a dot or an original echo in just about every room (even the bathrooms). I use echoes to control all of my lights, TVs, thermostats, etc. However, the show is just not a device that seems ready to me.

So where do I begin? Well, I will just list some of the issues:

Visual privacy, drop in is optional, but not welcome
Speaker isn't good, the dots have better speakers
Even at max, volume is still too low
No 360 sound, you have to be in front of the device to often hear the response
Bland/lifeless visuals, not a great touch interface
Design is not very attractive - it's really bulky for what it is and if it were beige, it would easily be straight out of 1983

He has terminal cancer, is in a wheelchair and has mental cognitive decline and can't work a modern device like this anymore. One of my new Amazon Echo Show devices is at my office and two are at my father's home: one next to his bed the other next to his recliner in the living room. There are doctors, nursess and health aides that come to my father's home almost every day that I need speak to. First of all, for calling anyone with an Echo Show you need a smartphone on BOTH ends with fairly new operating systems (Android 5.0 and Apple iOS 10 or higher). THE DEVICE WILL NOT WORK FOR VIDEO OR VOICE CALLS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SMARTPHONE. Amazon make no mention of this in the ""simple to set up and use"" section of theEcho Show listing on Amazon. Since my father lives out of state  I had to run out and buy a smartphone at Walmart before I flew back to be able to set up his two Echo Shows. That was a whole new expense I was not counting on. After activating the new smartphone and linking it to the new Echo Show devices I enabled the crucial ""Drop In"" feature on all the Echo Show devices on both my phone and the new smartphone I set up for my father. I thought about simply adding all three to my account but my parents have their own contacts that might want to use the drop in feature as well so I'd have to add all those contacts to my own contacts and then individually approve each contact and ignore the calls when they came in on my Echo devices...too complicated, their Echo devices should stand alone on their own. Finally, I mounted each Echo Show on a speaker stand to make it easier to move around. So back at my office I will ask Alexa to drop in on my father in the bedroom. (I changed the name of each Echo Show to Bedroom and Living Room). Except Alexa NEVER drops in to the bedroom. It's supposed to sense what device people in the other device are near, but it never does. I might have the doctor, nurse and my mother in the bedroom with my father and Alexa will NEVER drop in to that room, instead it will drop into the living room Echo Show even though there is no one in the living room. There is absolutely no way whatsoever for me to simply select which Echo Show I want to Drop In on from my device's touch screen in the ""recent activity"" window. So I have to repeatedly ask Alexa to drop in and it will randomly pick the correct device. After about 40 tries (literally) it will drop in on the correct device. Numerous calls to Amazon device support left them baffled. It was not until my fourth call, several hours on the phone, and lots or stress  that it was escalated to software people. It's absurd that you have to go through all this to make their device competive with Apple. Jeff Bezos this is unacceptable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If Amazon has thought through all the kinds of things the Show could do, then the literature with it is woefully inadequate.  When acquiring a new technology, I want a detailed ""how to"" for implementation.  The Alexa app is of very little use, some of which due to the poor index format and some due to the very high level content itself.  The ""instructions"" with the unit are of no use at all.  The on-screen instructions are not well packaged, and don't have ability to ask questions or go back to re-check.  I can see a huge potential for the Show.

It's always getting words wrong that the Dot picks up fine. If they are using the same servers and dictation software, I'm not sure why there would be a difference, but there is. Most of the time I will ask the Show to play music and the light will come on indicating that it's listening, but the Show does not respond and the light times out and nothing happens. The speakers sound good for the size, but overall I'm disapointed mostly because it has proven to be much less useful than the Dot  which I have located in the same room. I'm using different wake commands, so I know that one is not interfering with the response of the other. The screen is cool, but there isn't much UI/UX to do anything with. Since the dictation is always wrong I would like to be able to type seachers for music or youtube.

Four out of five of our house guests were so impressed with it when they visited they ended up ordering one for themselves and called us on it as soon as they got back home and hooked it up. Even our friends in England where at the time it hand not yet been introduced.
A couple of suggestions for future updates however.  We as well as our friends have all found it annoying that the screen continues to display recent callers. Some of those video calls took place a while ago. It sure would be nice if you could attache a time stamp to the recent callers notification to help you determine if you missed a call or not.
The second suggestion is minor but it would make more sense if Alexa asked you ""did you SAY (callers name)"" rather than ""did you MEAN"".  Alexa repeats the names exactly as you said so the clarification of SAY versus MEAN takes on an entirely more effective way to clarify.
Just my two cents worth. Keep up the good work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_160?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=160&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's good for the time and temperature, although sometimes the report from ""Accuweather"" is wildly inaccurate. For over a week this summer, it kept saying it was 10-12 degrees higher than the Weather Channel temps. One morning it showed 71 deg. at 2:30 am, the WC showed 58 deg. I went outside and it was nowhere close to 71. Usually it is 1 - 2 degrees different from the WC, but acceptable.

Recently, Amazon fixed some things about the Show that weren't broke, the screen font size and the screensaver images . Now, it is a constant visual annoyance!

The original default screensaver images were good, photos of nature, candy, fruit, etc. They were pleasant and inoffensive. Recently, Amazon changed the default screensaver and it's an epic fail. The images look like clip art put together by a child in a paint program. They're also including photos of people and places I could care less about with  their featured stories. Bring back the original, or make it an option. You can upload photos to use as screensaver, but who has the time (hours) for that.

Equally bad is their recent reduction in the size of the screen font, making it less ""accessible"" for some folks. We used to be able to see the temperature displayed below the time from across the room. Now it is HALF the size of the original and too tiny to see unless you are standing next to it. The Show would be better served by allowing users to customize their screen fonts and sizes. You can make things larger by tapping on the screen or asking Alexa to do it.... stupid solutions. Hello, the Show isn't a handheld tablet or smartphone. I don't want to walk across the room to tap on it or ask Alexa to do something that was good before they messed it up.

Alexa's streaming news, well sort of. The stories are usually a couple of days old, featuring science, oddities, human interest, and not much to write home about. Fortunately, Alexa avoids politics and anything salacious or gruesome. They are family friendly. Alexa's jokes and her original songs are also family friendly. What annoys me are the daily ""Three things to know"" and ""Birthday Roundup"", who cares.

Calling features and drop-ins - I like them. I only know a couple of people with the Show, but it is nice to have a visual conversation. We allow drop-ins, but you can turn it off. The camera is good, but I usually have it covered with a sticker unless I'm expecting a call....I should buy a new robe on Amazon.  I use Alexa to look up business addresses near me. Occasionally I use it to make phone calls, but only when I don't mind that it sounds like you are using a speaker phone.

Check traffic  - this skill is an Epic Fail. You have to go into the Alexa app and enter the to and from addresses. I tried this for my daily commute. It always gave me the same amount of time, whether traffic was good or bad. Worse, it gave me road designations that I've never heard of or seen on any map. I tried to delete the to and from addresses, but it wouldn't let me. Bizarre! It required addresses. I finally swapped my real addresses with stupid ones, eg. Google Headquarters in California to the Bailing Wire Museum in Texas.

Questions - Alexa doesn't know a lot of things. Sometimes you can ask her to check Wikipedia. Sometimes her answers are weird or wrong. I asked her the number of calories in Almond Roca. Her answer was 755 per serving! Wow, maybe for a sumo wrestler, but Google pretty much agrees it is 200 calories for one serving, 3 pieces. Don't believe everything you hear from Alexa.

Timers and alarms - quite useful. There are number of options in the Alexa app. You can also set recurring alarms.

Not useful! if you have more than one Amazon device, you can't set an alarm or timer for one in a different room. You have to ""walk"" into the other room and set the timer or alarm there.

Now the bad - music alarms. Aargh! I tried to make them work. You can set a music genre, but you will eventually get some pieces you don't like. Who wants to wake up to a song you don't like. You can set a playlist, with very specific wording. I said, ""set an alarm to my playlist Bob"", Alexa couldn't find it. I spent a half hour on the phone with an Amazon rep to figure out that I had to say, ""set an alarm to my Bob playlist"". I suggested Amazon make the words playlist and Bob (or the name of your list) in interchangeable order. I don't know if they fixed it. I've stopped using music alarms. Yes, you can use a playlist (of songs you do like),  but the alarm skill can't shuffle it. It will wake you up to the first song on the list, .....every time.

Videos - You can watch your Amazon prime videos here, but wouldn't you really rather watch them on a big screen?

Music - the speakers are decent and you can access your playlists on several platforms. Some songs will show the lyrics. I was surprised by lyrics I had misheard in the past.

Skills - be sure to read the reviews before adding them.

Lists - a pain. I created a list with numbers in a specific order. The list repeated them back in a different sequence. I tried to delete the useless list, but it is a convoluted process. You can delete items from the list, but not the list. You have to Archive it, then delete it from there. It took me a half hour of Googling to figure it out.

alexa.amazon.com - I use this online for settings, history, etc. Seriously, this needs a makeover, by someone with an HCI background. Can we say alpha order, or make things more intuitive. Why is the background black?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have a smart home, tones of technologies. We are very tech savvy people. The Echo Show is a huge disappointment, basically a waste of money, and we do not like this product at all.

Here's a few Pros and Cons.

1) Limited Skills App, majority of these skills app are useless to us. It doesn't have a lot of the TV apps like HBO GO or basic ABC app etc. If Echo Show has an Android App store then it's not that bad. Unfortunately, it has these Skills App that limits what you can do with this device.

2) Limited TV Provider, if you do not have Dish, Fios, Frontier, Optic HUB or FireTV then you can only view Prime Video, which sometimes require you to pay extra for certain shows or videos. Prime video is worse than Netflix, more older movies or lack of. Unfortunately, we have HBO, Apple TV, and none of the other providers listed above. This is useless to us.

3) You cannot upload your own music like you can on iTune. Limit you to Amazon Unlimited Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Tunein, Deezer and a couple of more which requires additional subscription fee. You do have the option to stream music from your bluetooth devices and use Echo Show as another bluetooth speaker, wasting battery life on your other devices. Don't even bother downloading the Amazon Music App if you already have other pre-built music app on your devices. Echo Show streams from Amazon Music the same way it does from your pre-built app. We already have wireless surround sound system and expensive bluetooth speakers that has better sounds than Echo Show.

4) You can listen to live radio and SiriusXm.

5) It cannot play youtube videos.

Of course, there are more cons and pros if I continue listing it out, this review will never end. Overall, If you are looking for a device to serve as an intercom, a bluetooth speaker, a camera, alarm clock or connect to some of your smart home device that is compatible than it is good enough for you. If the Skills app don't have most of your smart home technology apps and you are not a Prime Member (No Prime Video or Amazon Unlimited Music, Showtime), then this device isn't worth buying. If you think it's worth to pay $200+ for a device that requires more subscription fee then go for it.

Just a note, if you are using Echo Show as a camera, you cannot adjust the angle. We don't use it for anything, except for the kids to ask questions. Even very tech savvy young kids find this device limited.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_482?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=482&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just received it today. If you have an Echo, you really need this Show. Just to start - you see the time and weather ALL of the time. The sound is amazing. I listened to one song and the music filled my living room. My husband who is def not an easy sell, fell in love. I asked to see the trailer for a movie, and it was incredible. The sound, the picture was like watching and hearing on one of the best TV's.

I purchased it during prime days, and the price was so incredible, I really should have purchased 2, or even more. I would use this instead of alarm clocks - I could set them up as a way to talk to my husband when he is in the garage working.

You need this.  You will fall in love.  And the look and feel of it is astonishing.  It looks like a very expensive piece of equipment that you will be proud of displaying. I purchased the white one, but am so sorry that I didn't purchase another black one for my kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I think the touch screen adds a lot to the device and is well worth the extra $50 price tag. It integrated very easily with my smart home devices and works great with them. Controlling your music through the Echo is also a delight. I took one star off due to the number of times Alexa has said ""I don't know that"" Siri wins hands down in the information category. For example, I asked Alexa how long it takes to drive from Fort Myers Florida to Key West Florida. She doesn't know. No problem for Siri though. In fact every time I asked Siri a question that Alexa didn't know, Siri was able to come up with the information. Hopefully Alexa's knowledge acquisition will improve in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I looked at getting Echo Plus  for  zigbee support  of  My home automation.  My friend  advised me  Newer  edition was coming out  and to check into this,  the echo show,  I called  Amazon  spoke to Rep  and asked if supported Zigbee  stated he didn't  know  but would  check  puit me on hold and then came back and states yes  supports  Home automation and zigbee.  I then  waited to went on sale in July  Normally $229  each  were $129  each.  I bought  three  and  ONLY setup 2  because  I couldn't figure  How  to activate  Zigbee  so  opened a second one thinking maybe something wrong with first one  still no zigbee??  Began  exhaustive  search  online  for  info  and how to NOTHING about  Zigbee on these units  only  on  the older prior  the  Echo Plus.  I called  Amazon  and  asked Rep........  about Zigbee  they stated  NO zigbee  in this Version????  Why did  first  rep say yes  I based my buying it  based on his  obvious  wrong specs  on this item.  I took care  of  patient of mine  ( I'm a physician)  he works  locally for  amazon  he recommended I reach out to amazon and explain my issue they would most likely help.  I have  called twice  and  even asked for  higher level tech support  but all I get  is some low level  customer service  reps  who  just keep saying  use  Upgrade  with  unknown  value  Credit  for  your  item  and 30%  off  So  I was dubbed  by  first  rep  and  Now  feel like I will be dubbed  by trade  in where  I will lose money and  have to spend  alot more to get what I initially thought I was getting the first time.  For  being a Member  of  Amazon  since 2001  ( although I remember prior to this  buying books off here when all they handled were books)  and  Prime member for last few years.  I am Not happy  at all  with  amazon and or  the handling of this considering my loyalty  and spending  1000's  yearly on amazon.  I may just have to consider going to Google's  product or some other avenue  of  Home automation  which can handle Zigbee.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Therefore it has limited ability to be used unless it's during the day, a light is on, or your standing over the top of it at a wierd angle. Furthermore, it does not support multi person calling.  The screen and audio is pretty good. The cost for what it is offering is over priced considering the technology for the before mentioned limitations are inexpensive and available from the same company that Amazon ripped off it's idea. Lastly, it's support service has no idea about this product. If there is an issue and you call for help, the majority of the time they openly admit they don't know this product. I would say this product is a generation away from being exceptional, however that's assuming that the people in product development have a clue about these major limitations which should have been resolved before this one even being produced.

Occasionally the call drops or pixelates because of a weak connection, but most of the time the results are better than all of the previous options.  We have three non-video Echos and this does what they do as well and integrates with them to serve as the best room to room intercom we've ever had.  One minor quibble: the audio sensitivity of our Show seems to be a bit less than that of the audio-only Echos; a request of ""Alexa, set a timer for an hour"" may result in the timer going off in the bedroom 30' away rather than the Show 10' away but that is facing away from the person requesting it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm bad at reading instructions so I started setting up basis prompts. Took maybe 2 minutes with no additional effort. The device did take time to load as it was downloading an update.

YouTube trailers:Alexa shows a notification as soon as a new trailer comes out and immediately plays it if prompted.

It’s an overpriced speaker.
I was really hoping for improvements with the show but it’s the most frustrating piece of technology I have ever owned  takes great effort to setup and remember exact commands to use it if it decides to work at all. I’d be rich if I got a quarter everyone she say hmm I don’t know that or ignores me completely.

Bought 3 of these for Christmas Presents, YOUTUBE is no longer supported which is the reason I thought these will be cool gifts, now I just stuck my family with a useless amazon device, Amazon should be ashamed of their deceptive promotion of the show.

after getting over the initial disappointment of not having YOUTUBE, I have a love/hate relationship with my Echo.  I have a complete automated home with TPlink and sometimes I can turn on my plugs/lights using voice commands and sometimes not.  I am ending up using the Kasa application on my phone more and more because I am tired of yelling at my Amazon Show and repeating myself several times

Some of the features are nice such as setting up a key word that turns on multiple devices - I just say Alexa-Good Morning and my TV, lights come on and I get my traffic and weather report.

The recipe feature is nice - able to scroll up or down with just a word.
The kids enjoy watching Sponge Bob at the kitchen counter while we are cooking.

Since I purchased several for family members - we can talk over the Show, this is a nice feature - kind of like SKYPE and once setup is easy to use, also the drop in feature is great to drop in on the kids to tell them things like come down stairs for dinner or brush your teeth and go to bed now, and with the automated plugs - I can also turn off their TV's and lights.

Annoying things like it's inability to search the web for information to respond to questions, and the lack of flexibility to understand questions.  You have to ask questions in a certain way if you want an answer and sometimes I get frustrated trying to remember skill phrases - because if you don't ask just right - you will end up repeating over and over again to get a response.

All in all I find that I end up yelling at Alex several time before I get the results that I ask for. Kind of frustrating

^-15-2018 Update
This thing still sucks - it is not getting better at all - never does what I ask it to do - it says it turns lights off - but doesn't and I have to repeat myself 3-4 times before it responds. Drop in feature is awful if you have multiple devices, I say drop in on family room and it drops in on the kitchen, if it can even find the drop in at all - most of the times it says it doesn't know that contact,  Adding things to the shopping list or appointments are the same experience, you have to repeat yourself 3-4 times before it will work - I used to keep up with the new commands and features and actually try them - it's really hard to remember the correct commands to open apps/features so I give up - I also will ask it a question like what actor won the most awards and it tells me what a boat is - still don't recommend buying this thing unless you like repeating yourself over and over, having it not do what you ask","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They received their preordered Echo Show just before they left to come for their visit so they brought it with them. I liked it...so after they left I ordered two Echo Show's and got the $100 discount. The only reason I ordered via Best Buy was because I was able to get 12 months free financing on my purchase. My Echo family has grown...currently I have two Echo's, two Echo Dot's, one Echo Tap and now two Echo Show's...LOVE them all! Yesterday I requested an invitation to be able to purchase the Echo Look. I ordered a little 8"" turntable via Amazon so I can swivel my nightstand Echo Show and liked it so much I'm having a second one delivered today for my other Echo Show!

EDIT: I forgot to mention how I use my Echo’s... Local Weather, weather from areas where my family members live. Music, Videos, Audio Books etc... Amazon Music Unlimited, My Amazon Music, Pandora Radio, Tunein, iHeart Radio. My Calendar Events, Voice/Test msgs, Amazon Notifications, News Briefings, LiveWatch security system via Alarm . com, Philips Hue Lights, RING doorbell, Honeywell Total Connect for changing my thermostat settings, reading audio books via Audible, recently added “Drop In” with family members using Echo Show...and the list goes on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_292?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=292&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did not know that YOU TUBE was no longer supported on this device due to some conflict with You Tube/ Google and Amazon. I may or may not return the item for this very reason because You Tube was going to be one of our major uses for the Echo Show.

Update 6/19:  I gave it a few nights and have decided it needed to go back. I thought maybe I could live with You Tube being supported anymore which I was willing to do. The thing that broke the back was the constant news blurbs/facts and ""try This"" which covers the screen.
I have down graded it to two stars.

This is a product that is completely designed off hypothetical features. When you see the commercials and people request to see the front door - They show the front door video application loading in a few seconds and in reality it's like 45 seconds on almost all functions that require video. Just doesn't work nearly as smooth as it's marketed. At best it's really used just as an Echo Dot, asking questions and getting answers but now when can see dialogue on the screen.

Oh, and not being able to watch Netflix or Hulu on this just add insult to injury. Today, it's not even close to worth $220.00.

If you have an echo or an echo dot and want to upgrade you will LOVE this echo show! I have one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom upstairs. I love listening to music with the lyrics. We have connected it to our front door using ring and our air conditioners. It is nice to turn the ac up or down when you are on the opposite side of the house or even in bed. I think the people that are disappointed with this product are unrealistic in what they expected. For the price, I think this thing is amazing. I mean it is the first of its kind. I am excited already for them to come out with updates and new releases. I even play some of the games it has, like deal or no deal when I am in the kitchen cooking. I also use it for my morning news update. It really is great. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE: Sometimes the alexa upstairs hears me when I am trying to talk to the alexa downstairs and then music will start playing upstairs and I have to go upstairs to turn that one off. Not that big of a deal though. I even took this with me to watch a movie while I was taking a relaxing bath... Alexa play me a funny movie! I use Alexa so much my son's first word was Alexa!

First,it constantly cuts off while playing music,as if you said her name. When we cough or just say any random thing she is in the mood to pick up,the music goes mute again like you are talking to her.
Second,she consistently tells me,""hmmm,I don't know that one""..This is really getting old to me!!.
Third,she is not very helpful.  I constantly have to go elsewhere for the information I am looking for.
Fourth,when I use her to stream Spotify,she plays only the same 3 bands on my list and then starts over. She never just plays through the list like she is supposed to,and if I have her shuffle music,she will only shuffle 2 bands over and over again.
My huge positive with my Amazon Echo Show is that even when she shouldn't be,she IS TOTALLY listening. I like that though,because it makes me feel safe as I know if anything happens here,she is recording it all.
Hope this helps!!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, for some specific circumstances, like mine, the Echo Show is great. I have a 75-year old mother who lives in Asia and I have tried to get her to use Skype and similar apps for years, with no success. I bought her a laptop and an iPad--the laptop was too complicated (font too small, double mouse clicks needed too difficult for consistent results, etc.) and she didn't keep the iPad charged. Even when I tried to keep the iPad permanently plugged in, she didn't like the touch screen. Elderly people sometimes don't interact effectively with touch screens, which can be unresponsive to their touches, possibly due to skin moisture content.  Given these past issues, I was really excited when the Echo Show with the drop-in feature was announced and bought a pair immediately. I just set up one of them for her and, to my great relief, she really likes it!

It is on my account and I enabled ""drop in"", so that I can check in on her in the morning and evening.  My mother knows when to expect me and doesn't find the drop-in intrusive or creepy.  The sound is pretty clear and the video does not lag much, if at all, probably because she does have good wifi (10-30mpbs, depending on the time of day). She likes that she doesn't have to immediately drop what she is doing to answer my calls, like she would with a phone call. I have set it up so that she can call me by voice control, in case she falls and can't get up--I am in the US but I can call for local help, if necessary.  She enjoys listening to music on it and using the timers and alarms. These are really limited uses and a poor value, compared to a tablet, but I really don't care about any of that. This is the first device that has worked well for my mother and being able to see her daily is priceless to me.

a few random comments:
--The Echo Show works fine internationally, on the right type of wifi. I couldn't get it to work properly on a cellular wifi hotspot, in either the US or Asia.
--The power adapter is dual-voltage.
--My mother speaks English. My primary interest is the drop-in feature that doesn't require any understanding of English, though.
--Alexa is pretty resilient with foreign accents. Alexa understands most of my mother's commands. I have explained that she can make mistakes without hurting anything and can just repeat her request.  This has been less intimidating than a laptop that freezes up with mistakes.
--I have not been able to set up the weather for a foreign country yet, but my mother likes hearing what my weather is like.  Anyone have success setting up weather in a different country?
--Her test calls to the app on my iPhone have not been completely reliable (with 2 failed attempts out of 10 test calls), but that is still better than having no other option. Of course, her cell phone and land line are more reliable, but this is still a good back up, especially if she can't get reach her physical phones. I think it helps if I refresh the Alexa app on my phone, so I close and open the app daily.
--I disabled purchases on it, just to be safe.
--Even with the TV on pretty loud, Alexa still recognizes when she is called. Compared to Siri on my iPad Pro and iPhone 7 plus, Alexa on the Echo Show is much more responsive.

I would give the Echo Show 5 stars based on how much it has helped my specific circumstances, but it's far from perfect and needs more development to be useful to a wider range of people.  4 stars overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have 3 Alexa devices in our house, and we use them all, everyday. I love the idea of the screen. We can now see lists, music videos, and the screen gives us prompts for new things that Alexa can do.
My ONLY minor complaint is that the sound seems a bit more muffled than our other devices. The sound is not as crisp and clear. I have looked for ways to adjust sound settings, but have not found any. It seems there is too much bass in Alexa's voice.

What I like the least:  Much of its core functionality is severely limited since Youtube, Netflix and amazon can’t play nice.  I had high hopes.  I wish I’d placed my money elsewhere.

6 Month Update:  I originally gave this 2 stars.  Downgrading to 1 after 6 months of ownership.  The device is useless.  I never ever use it, and it’s sitting on my office desk, where it should be handy.  The Amazon squabble with Google continues to limit the YouTube capability that would make this device worth having.  My family continues to get good use out of the Echo II and the Echo Tap and the Echo puck.  I’ve had VERY few hiccups with Amazon over their existence.....this happens to be a grand disappointment.  If you MUST have a device of this nature, buy the Kindle 10 with the Dock.  Much more useful.  I will be shocked if they continue to make the Show now that the HD10 Dock option is available.

We used an old iPhone, changed SIM card from ATT to t-mobile. T-mobile has a pay as you go plan and since all will be on Wi-Fi and phone only used to set up Echo show it was cheapest option. $50 to activate and $10 credit on pay as you use.

However, turning notifications back off allowed cloudcam to continue to function. So I've upgraded my review since my wife absolutely loves every other feature and this very important feature is now working as it should.

If you are experiencing issues with cloud cam and echo show go to alexa app > settings > {accounts} Notifications > {Skills} Amazon Cloud Cam > Alexa Notifications

Try toggling on alexa notifications and see if you can get echo show to display your cloudcam. This worked for me - although no one could explain why notifications were required for displaying cloudcam on my echoshow when it would display on my other alexa enabled devices just fine (Fire TV, etc) and on the cloud cam app. But the problem is at least solved for me. See original problem below:

Bought this device for my wife for Christmas and while most features work as advertised it DOES NOT WORK WITH CLOUDCAM. We have two cloud cams and both are set up and functioning well and we can view them on our mobile devices and our linked Fire TV, BUT the echo show wouldn't show them out-of-box (it found cameras but wouldn't display). So we upgraded to v. 597464020, the newest software update and Alexa says ""this software version does not support cloud cam"" it's the LATEST SOFTWARE VERSION!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wouldn't buy again.","August 1, 2018","I don't use this for video chat, so I can't attest to the success of that feature. I use it basically the same way as my regular Echo, but sometimes I stream videos on it.
The video capability, for some reason, doesn't seem to offer as many choices from Amazon Video as you would find on your TV or laptop. It looks like Amazon narrows your selection to only a few results.
It works well for streaming radio and music, but terrible for podcasts and audiobooks because of the pause feature. I'm a mother of two young children and I frequently have to pause what I'm listening to in order to tend to something. But the pause on the Echo Show only lasts about 10 to 15 seconds before the device  cancels and returns to the home screen. It's tolerable for audiobooks because Audible saves your spot, but for podcasts you have to start the ENTIRE thing from the beginning. And because they want to force you to use the voice commands instead of the touch screen you have to say ""Alexa fast forward, Alexa fast forward, Alexa fast forward"" hundreds of times to get to where you were.

What I do not like is the screen flickered for several months despite doing everything I could think of, resetting, moving etc and then, inexplicably, it righted itself, so that's good but who knows how long that will last. Additionally, this device just does not seem to ""hear"" and understand commands reliably.  I often need to get quite loud and repeat myself multiple times, that's a bit frustrating.  Honestly, i do not really notice any sound quality improvement over my Echo, 2nd generation that I have downstairs.

Don't get me wrong I love the Alexa cloud service and have dots and the original echo in my home too. I hope they keep updating because at this point I don't find myself really drawn to using the show over the other products. The video features are not that appealing and I don't think I will be using the video calling as other tools are better and don't require others to have this set up in their home or phone. So it's a nice toy at this point but not a game changer. If it becomes a smart home hub in the future I might be singing a different tune at that point. If you are looking for an initial alexa device and are willing to spend the money, I would go with this because the extra features and the speakers are quite good in this device. If you have echos or dots and are on the fence, you won't be missing too much by holding off in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The other basic features are improved as well, for example if you ask for the weather you get a visual with the information per day on the screen, the daily flash briefing now includes video, when you play music you get to see the lyrics. The new features such as YouTube and Amazon Video are pretty cool too. This device is in its early days, Amazon has invented a new category, don't buy this if you expect it to be a tablet that talks or to have ""apps"", this is still a devices intended to be use with your voice and offers visuals as a complement.

But when I heard that the Gen1 Show's software had been updated to the Gen2's standard, and saw the the warehouse price was $99, it seemed like a great time to take the plunge.
The unit I received came in what appeared to be the original packing. It even came with the protective plastic film covers on it. I chose the ""acceptable quality"" selection, but I have not been able to find any sign of wear  or usage whatsoever. It certainly appears to be brand new.
Set up was simple, as usual, but after I got it set up I could not find a browser. I had to go back to settings to find out that it needed an update. Not a big deal, but I don't know if someone unfamiliar with Echo products would have known to do that. After a 15 minute update process the Show functioned perfectly. I was able to get my Hulu account set up on it, and my Pandora, Tune In, and other accounts from my other Echoes transferred seamlessly. Having used the Show Mode on my HD8 tablet quite a bit it didn't take long to figure things out.
A couple of oberservations:
- YouTube does work now, but it is not really integrated into the whole Echo universe. You can't do everything hands free. Having said that, it does work well. I would not have purchased a Show without the ability to use YouTube.
-having a browser is really nice. It functions just like any other browser. I was disappointed, but not surprised, when Crackle and some other steaming video services did not work, but with YouTube, Hulu, and Prime Video I don't think I will ever be without something to watch. The ability to look things up with the browser is great, and I am really glad that they included it.
- I have heard a lot of comments about how the Gen2 show sounds much better than the Gen1. If that's true, then the Gen2 must sound incredible, because the Gen1 sounds really good to me, as good  if not better than my Gen2 Echo.
- the 7 inch screen is fine. Of course I watch a lot of movies on my Fire Tab7, so I might not be a good judge. But the Show screen looked fine to me. I watched two movies on it in a row without any issues.
-the calling features are the same as on my tablet in show mode, which means they work well. I have bèen video chatting with my family via FB Messenger, and I am interested in seeing if it works better with the echos. I will update my review after getting more experience with it.
I know that this review is of limited interest, as the gen1 Shows are about gone. But if you have been on the fence about buying a Show, right now they are a great value at $99. So buy one. While you still can!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Overall it's a nice product. Much better speaker than the dot and nice and responsive touch screen. It's thicker than I thought it would be so fitting them on a small end table or night stand may create issues if you have other stuff like we do. For most people it's probably not worth the cost of around 3-4 echo dots. The dot does pretty much everything the show does (I had 6 dots) just no screen so while it's nice not really a need right now. The issue is unless friends and family also have the echo show you can't really use the video ""drop in"" feature that was a main featured selling point. Pains of being an early adopter I guess. I think with a few software tweaks it could and will be a lot more useful. Things like ringing your phone when you don't have the echo app open when someone calls from an echo device would be much more useful since I don't have echo app open usually. Also it would be great to be able to hang the device or having a removable camera so you can place it without having to move the whole unit around would allow you to use it as a baby monitor. Right now I don't know how you can as the camera is naturally positioned slightly upward due to the device being slightly tilted back when sitting on a flat surface. Anyways I'm sure it will get better but w/o that killer app/feature I would imagine that the dot which can do like 99% of the things that the show can for 1/4 the price is what most people will buy.

Lastly Amazon if you're reading please don't forget about Alexa like Apple did with Siri (that's hard for me to admit being a huge Apple guy).

(all of the pictures make it look nearly Ipad size to me and it is really more like alarm clock size.)  You have to install apps to get skills, to show specific things.  If I want to see a recipe I have to ask a recipe app to show me a recipe and if there is no recipe then you get nothing.  I wish I could just google with it.  I like being able to see the calendar and the events of the day.  I like being able to drop in on the camera at home and the teleconferencing works pretty well.

Alexa is handy to have around. I use her to set timers and search the web all the time. You can tell her to add stuff to a  shopping list and it is also added to the Alexa app on your phone, which is great. Im still learning what it can do.

Can't get the slideshow to work (and neighter could 3 techs at Amazon). 2. Can't disable the display night mode (so screen goes almost black with very dim digital clock on totally black background for about 12 hours at night). 3. After display night mode goes off all you have is a totally black screen with a nicely lit digital time showing - and it will stay like that all day long unless you manually change it to a picture but that won't stay on screen but a few minutes and then back to black screen) - if it were not for the little time display showing all day, my tv TURNED OFF looks as good!. 4. Can't change the clock style. Alexa works fine however and the one thing that I really wanted and will keep me from sending this back is the fact that it will show all of my Arlo cameras throughout the house perfectly...All contact with Amazon say they are referring these problems to their development team to seek resolution so until these issues are addressed properly, the rating stays the same...Just in  case you are wondering if I have a habit of giving bad reviews, this is the first time I have ever given a bad review for any AMAZON branded product and I average 160 order from Amazon every 6 months and been a customer since 2003.The Echo Spot, which I have ordered 2 since getting the Show, is so much more functional than the Show and much better looking...nice clock backgrounds and the backgrounds will rotate and show current weather in your town, and reminers you have set...just cannot believe the Show, as a supposedly upscale product, lacks at least a decent looking all-time on screen. Perhaps some of you have found a way to get around some or all of these problems but I have not nor have the techs at Amazon that I have talked to.
I will gladly upgrade this review if and when it is deemed necessary as I am a VERY loyal Amazon customer and would not know what to do if something ever happened to them...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd hoped that the ""APs"" that it promised would be coming along a lot faster and better than they have. I get the idea that having a window to ""artificial intelligence"" could be a nice home feature (works for Iron Man), but this is more like buying the first Model T in the neighborhood; cool tech with a lot of maturity needed before it fulfills its promise. Amazon should have taken their time before tying their name to most of the ""skills"" out there, they don't really work very well, are often just frustrating to deal with. One thing that Apple always did well was to be careful about who they let share their name, something Amazon should consider. They need to vet their skills list rather than take the blame when they don't work well which is what's happening. Amazon really needs to spin this whole AI off to another platform or risk falling behind their other ""super server"" competitors.  An ""Alexa"" home site of it's own, outside the Amazon home shopping network is where to start. I would still rather have the Model T over a horse, but that's not the issue Amazon, there are going to be a lot more options than the Model T soon.

Example: Listening to a playlist on Spotify. In the past I could say ""next song"" and it skips. The Echo show has no idea what to do with that command.
or
It constantly scrolls thru news feeds on the screen. One of the items interested me, but all I could do is ask Alexa for top stories, then use the touch screen so it could have issues displaying the article. I had to use a laptop if I wanted to know more.

I have one on my bedside table. The screen is bright, and I know there is a command to make it go black. When I say ""Alex screen off,"" it asks for which device I want, and I have it named ""Master Show"". It says it can't find that device.

Nice bright screen, and audio quality is better than I expected.  This has a lot of potential, but I find the current software implementation to be very lacking.  You can't talk naturally to it unless what you want to do is in the small set of commands it understands.

For example, ""alexa show me a calendar for june"" ought to show me a calendar on the screen.  Hardly an unreasonable request,  but it doesn't know how to do that without installing a 3rd party ""skill"" and then I have to remember to say some unintuitive or tongue twisting prefix phrase first (""ask foo bar to show me ..."").  I should be able to create custom phrases as aliases for these cumbersome phrases.

I'm especially disappointed with the Ring doorbell and camera integration, particularly as Amazon now owns Ring.  The Ring ""skill"" should be a shining example of what Alexa can do; instead it's an example of a ""skill"" that's rated by almost everyone as 1 star for its inability to do much of anything. You'd expect a skill that connects to an electronic doorbell to notify you when someone rings the bell or motion is detected.  Alexa's Ring skill does neither.  You can view a live feed and nothing else.

The Google calendar integration is also lame.  It will show events, but not tasks.  Why?  There's a bunch of third party task skills, but none of them integrate with Google tasks and require you to use their own task system.  Meh.

Another irritation is that you can't customize the main screen. other than choosing the background.  Why can't I see the next few entries in my calendar on the main screen?  You see what Amazon wants you to see, and nothing else.  I could write my own skill of course, but at the moment Alexa won't show you anything without you asking for it.

I'm keeping this because the software can be improved, and hopefully it will be.  This could turn out to be a very useful device, if Amazon brings the software up to par with the hardware.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wait until Amazon improves its capability. It has a touchscreen but no internet browsing feature. No youtube. It requires constant touchscreen interaction. You cannot place the unit out of arms reach and expect it to navigate with just voice commands. This applies to almost everything. For example,if you ask to see a video that Amazon doesnt control, it will take you to a website that Amazon approves of (other than Youtube) and you will be presented with an ad before you can see the video. We are all used to this, but the button that allows you to skip the ad if your not interested after 5 seconds must be manually pushed or the entire ad will play, and sometimes the video will not start after the ad. As I said, because of this constant need for touchscreen input, it must be within arms reach to complete even the simplest request. On a phone, if you make a voice request to Siri or Google, you will be taken to the web and shown relevant pages to complete your inquiry. Not with this unit,since there is no web browser you get what Amazon determines you want or nothing at all. Also, some results are ad driven, pointing toward things to purchase. The product is just ok at the time of this review. If it was more like the Fire Tablet I would definitely recommend it and give it 5 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I called Amazon and they told me to take the unit back to the original settings.  This was supposed to resolve the issue—it didn’t. Next Amazon had me send the unit back.  They said they reprogrammed the unit and it was fixed.  It lasted one day and started the popping again.  This time Amazon sent me another unt, which turned out to be reconditioned and after one day started popping.  I have two other echos neither of them is a Show.  I don’t have issues with either.  When I connected the unit to a blue tooth speaker it didn’t pop.  Whatever was going on was internal to the unit.  If you go on the various websites there are lots of complaints about this issue.  All of the responses said Amazon addressed the issue the same way.  I finally was able to convince the customer service rep to find a way to get me a new unit.  This was a long discussion and they swore up and down that it was up to the tech to determine if they could fix it or not.  I told them I would not accept another “reconditioned “ unit.  The way they gave me the unit was to give me a credit on my account and I bought it on the website.  Doesn’t really seem like the solution to getting a new unit justified the 45 minute debate with the customer service rep.  Anyway, I have been using the unit about 6 weeks and it doesn’t pop.  It does seem to pause briefly while playing music but at least no pop.

Beauchamp","What happened to YOUTUBE?? Updated Feedback!!","November 16, 2017","What Happened to Youtube? You advertised this as being able to use youtube? Now it doesnt work.

So two minutes after I wrote this they called me from 2069220880 to get feedback about why i was upset over youtube.
I explained that because we had bout four for family members and was expecting to do what was advertised in the comercials... such as loading youtube videos on cooking or allowing family members to watch our saved videos and vice versa.. yes we can still live facetime with the show.. but it was also nice for it tobe able to not be a one trick pony.

Amazon show Has tons of possibilities but right now I would not recommend it.. it has not leaped into the video potential it should be..
fx i own lots and lots of amazon movies.. but Alexa will not show you the correct movie 90% of the time.. you almost always have to say Alexa show me my movies or my watch list in order to find what you want. But worse, if its not the very first few in your library then it will not show up because its currently limited to show you 25 or 30 options. So you need to remove it from watch list and re add it so its the first pick.

Also.. my whole house is wired with nest and cox communications cameras but Show doesnt work with them. Even though it should.

Its just not ready.. it could be an amazing leap forward in Home devices but Amazon Show just is an infant and has a way to go before reaching that sexy electronic stage of say an Apple product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_495?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=495&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Theoretically A screen should work for the line of echo devices. However the more you use it the more you realize it's really just a novelty.  I don't need to see visuals of the weather for my 7 day forecast.  Also, when this product first launched it was very easy to ask for a YouTube video.  Unfortunately Google took that ability away because they are thinking about coming up with their own visual device.  That was a big selling point a lot of people who bought this and to have it Stripped Away without a real explanation from Amazon left a sour taste a lot of people's  mouths.  Now you have to rely on Bing searches and Dailymotion videos, with glitchy ads.  Even asking to see your Prime videos is problematic.  So which option is correct? Show my Prime videos? Or is it show my video library?  I've had the device for a year and I still don't remember.  The one positive about this device are the news briefings.  I would rather see news segments on the Echo Show than hear about them on any of my other devices.  I don't know how good the second generation of this is, so maybe they'll improve on things.  But as someone with over four devices, this is by far the worst.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_131?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=131&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So, how does that screen influence the product?  It makes the good things better, the bad things a LOT worse and adds a new bad feature of unwanted, intrusive advertising.

First impressions are it’s not nearly as configurable or useful as you’d think. You can’t use it by default as a photo frame without explicitly telling it to start a slideshow. The actual set up is OK, but the marketing doesn't match the reality.  All Echo products share the same flaw that they are tethered to a smartphone or computer for much of the customization and configuration, which is bad for a product whose marketing includes grandparents or other older, less computer proficient audiences.

Worse, after you pay $130 or more dollars for this, Amazon then uses that screen real estate as THEY want to, instead of how you, the consumer want to, by constantly pushing Alexa advertisements at you with no option to disable them.  Imagine if every 30 seconds, your Echo or Echo dot just blurted out, ""Try Alexa for movie showtimes"" with no option to turn it off.  This is literally what this device does, only with the screen.

So if you buy this thinking it’s going to be a cool gift for a grandparent, to use as an electronic picture frame and video-chatting device, keep in mind that they’re going to have to specifically start the slideshow every time they want, (with no ""endless loop"" option, when it ends it just goes back to the homescreen) instead of having a photo frame setting start after your last video chat ends as a screensaver.  They will also see Alexa advertisements at all other times on the home screen.

In the best of circumstances, the calls, messaging or drop-ins function of all Echo devices is only a 2 because the contacts handling is so flawed.  Maybe even only a 1.  The device doesn't have its own contacts book, instead it scans your contacts and simply adds all of your contacts who have ever registered a device with Amazon.  That one guy you know from work who gave you his business card three years ago but you've never talked to since?  He's in your Amazon contacts and has the same privileges as your parents unless you specifically change it.  But you can't delete him from your contacts unless you remove him from your phone's contacts.  Horrible idea on something that is supposed to be voice activated.  Know a John Smith and a Johnny Smith--one that's your brother and another that's from work?  That's your problem.  Its not perfect, but the way Apple has its Facetime contacts is SO much superior to this.

Not only is this bad from a usability perspective, its horrible from a privacy perspective.  Think of Creepy Guy.  How happy is he going to be that every single girl whose email address he has shows up in his Amazon Address book--allowing him to call, message or ""Drop-in"" on their lives, unexpectedly?  Guarantee a lot of creepy people love this setting.

This device is so flawed that I revised my rating down to a 1 star, especially after thinking more about the contact management debacle.  I don't ""hate it"" but I can't recommend that anyone buy it without seriously thinking it through, and asking yourself why an iPad mini mounted in a frame isn't 100% better.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When you have a timer set, you can see the time clicking off. It's great for monitoring your Alexa compatible cameras. (I have a Wyze) the sound is great. There are so many more things you can do with this one that make it well worth the $129.00 I paid for it on Prime Day Week compared to a regular echo. I already have a Echo plus with the build in hub, and  I am surprised that this one does not have a hub option as well.
I have one issue with it. When you speak to the regular round Echos, A very visible blue light circles the top that you can see from all directions to let you know that it is listening. With the Echo Show, unless you are in front of the screen, you don't know if it is listening until you hear an answer from it. Also, I am not sure how you are made aware of notifications unless you are directly in front of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_63?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=63&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I own a Echo and Echo Dot for couple years, but I haven't used them that much because the hackers or bored Amazon employees are always in the back of my mind.  I work in Risk Management industry so it doesn't help knowing what I know.  My struggle with privacy issues just went out the window with Echo Show.  My mom is 92 year old in a living assistant home in another state.  Due to her slight dementia and hearing loss, she no longer uses a cell phone.  So I put the Echo Show in her bedroom.  The #1 thing, I love about the Echo Show is the ""drop-in"" feature.  My mom's nurse and home health aides now know that I can be watching at any time.  That reduce some of risk for abuse with new employees.  The #2 best feature is that my mom doesn't have to remember to do anything. I put a sign on the Echo show  "" Alexa,  call my daughter""  and it connect directly to Iphone for free.  The 3rd feature that I love,  the Echo Show is louder than a phone or cell phone, she can hear me without her hearing aides.  I don't have to repeat myself over & over.  Again, can I mention how I love the ""drop-in"" feature, it make it so easy to connect when there's a emergency.  I don't have to worry about somebody not answering the phone.  The other Echo Show features probably won't be used that much but ease of having video conversation is so worth it.  Echo show a great tool for the elderly population.  One downside that I hope be improve in future updates, the Echo Show angle should be adjustable.  I had to tape some clips on the back to improve the camera angle, otherwise it does capture too much of the ceiling.  I think I saw 3rd party Echo Show stands that my help with this issue.  For my 92 year old mom, I love the Echo Show, the hackers can watch all they want.

In fact, my entire house runs on this. I have several dots, Amazon Echos and smart home features that connect. I love that I can now pull up my nest camera's on the show, instead of searching for my phone. I do hate that I purchased the show right before the spot release. - Technically for the money you're paying an extra $100 for the screen size and the dual speakers. Otherwise, no difference.

My only negative comment about Amazon Echo in general, is that is has no ability to answer more complex questions (that are not Wiki based). - It seems Google may have the one-up on this. I hope they soon fix that issue. As for now, streaming music, video calling, nest camera views and simple Wiki questions will have to do.

I ordered this device this morning, 11/16/2017  and it arrived in the early evening of 11/16/2017. The same day delivery was nice.

I purchased this device for a couple of reasons but one of the main reasons was to use it to view my EZVIZ cameras.

And that has been very frustrating. I do not know if it is an EZVIZ problem or an Echo Show problem, but it sure feels like an Echo Show problem.

First you have to turn off image encryption on the cameras, which seems stupid. Then, at your requests, it MIGHT show you a camera or two or it might go to a blank screen. At this point, even if it has shown you a camera or two, once it goes to the blank screen, you are not going to be viewing any more of the cameras.

I bought two of these today - one is for a gift but I wanted it to work 100% sucessfully and the one as a gift is for a Christmas gift and I really wanted the camera thing to work well.

I am extremely disappointed in the camera feature. I like the EZVIZ cameras - I have five. To not be able to successfuly view them, the Echo Show has lost a LOT of luster.

If I unplug the Echo Show and then plug it back in, letting it restart, you can again view an EZVIZ camera or two, until it again goes to a blank screen, and then you again can no longer view your EZVIZ cameras.

SIGH. :(

Update 03/09/2018

Not long after the above review was submitted, though I do not recall how long, Amazon contacted me and we reviewed the various issues noted above. My Amazon contact's name is Beka. Bekah was very helpful and worked to obtain information needed help get the issue fixed. She had contacted me a couple of tiimes plus we spoke on the phone a couple of times as well.

Per information from Beka - the problem was worked on by Amazon being in contact with the camera manufacturer EZVIZ. I received an email from Bekah a few days prior to March 1st 2018 and she stated that EZVIZ would update their camera software on March 2nd, 2018.

A few days later, and again today 03/09/2018 - I asked Alexa (via my Echo Show) to show me each of my many EZVIZ cameras and the previous problems I was having with the Echo Show going from camera to camera at my requests did not occur. As a result, I am updating my rating of the Echo Show from a 2 to a 4. I would use 4.5 if I could.

Also - I want to thank you, Bekah, for the wonderful customer service you provide.

Have a great day, everyone!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was excited for the show so I bought two. One for me and one for my inlaws. The adds feature people using the Echo Show to easily call each other.  Calling and messaging are only supported if you have the Alexa app on a smart phone. My inlaws are in their 80's. They don't have a smart phone. I hoped that giving them an echo show would allow them to place video calls to their kids. Tech support says the best I can do is register the device to my account and enable drop ins. I am very disappointed. I feel that the adds are deceiving because they leave out essential details.

Buy a standard Echo.","March 22, 2018","Let me start by saying that I have seven other Echo devices and love each and every one of them. This turned out to be a waste of money. We don't have security cameras that can connect to it, and aren't buying them for the thrill of watching this from a stationary unit in our kitchen instead of on our phone or tablets, we don't want to sit idle in front of the thing while watching a video, we just use our tablets, the apps custom tailored for it rarely do more than keep a picture on the screen, and the video searches rarely turn up anything of interest.

I just can't give this more than two stars. I regret spending my money on it.

UPDATE
------------
Amazon called me during a meeting, left a message saying they would bother me again five minutes later and, sure enough, they did. They then left a message saying they would send me an e-mail with contact information. That e-mail contained nothing more than a link to the ""Contact Us"" page.

So, Amazon: I'm sorry I couldn't answer your call at 10:30 in the morning on a Friday, and the follow-up five whole minutes later - I work (which is how I had the money to waste on this). Let me expound on my earlier comments in-case you wanted the additional information:

My biggest problem with this is the functionality compared to the cost. I already have a $50 Fire tablet with Alexa. I have several Dots, a Tap, and an Echo. I already have everything I need with those devices, and without a tether. I struggle to see why this is worth $230 when the $50 tablet does more than it and has a battery. If my security cameras worked with it, I could see asking it to see who was at the door... well, that is, when I didn't already have my tablet handy.

This is a device needing a purpose. I think you thought that purpose would be cameras or YouTube. I do have to admit, losing YouTube was a pretty big blow to this device. I was at least looking up videos here and there then. It's unfortunate that Google got upset because you wouldn't list their competing product in your store. My advice to them would be to make their store better, not whine about not getting to come to the Amazon party, but, back to the point...

I would have paid $150 for this and been relatively happy. I'd still be kicking myself for the useless thing sitting on my kitchen counter collecting dust, but I wouldn't be as upset. Let me also say this: If this product came out, with no other Echo devices available, I would marvel at it and find it infinitely useful. I'd still be gagging at the price, though, and I wouldn't have bought more and placed them throughout my home. I'm glad you didn't release this first - I wouldn't have come back for more.

Thank you for the other Echo devices - they're wonderful and the price points are on-the-nose. I couldn't do without them at this point. This thing though... you can take it, the Spot, and the Look and dole them out to the yuppies who can tell all their friends about them as they collect dust on their kitchen counters.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_455?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=455&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The display of ""Alexa hints"" on the home screen is extremely annoying. In settings there is a switch that indicates the hints can be turned off but it appears its not working the way you'd think it would. I spent about an hour with the Amazon tech folks and apparently there's no way to remove this unpleasant display of hints. It seems there's going to have to be an ""update"" to correct this aggravating banner. I think it'll come down to having enough customers telling Amazon this is unacceptable. For the price of this product we should not have to be confronted with displays saying ""Try"" Alexa tell me some bad poetry"" plastered across the home screen photos I want to see. Because of this obvious shortcoming I'm posting 4 stars. If things change I'll reconsider.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At this time, the Echo Show is capable of showing 2 timers at once, and you can scroll the display to see more but I wish it could show at least 3 without scrolling. Obviously, it would be easy enough to do by making the font size smaller or tiling the timers horizontally and vertically on the screen (instead of just a vertical list as it is now). Also, the screen seems to go back to the home screen after an amount of time and I wish I could lock it to the timer screen while timers were running, this would be hugely helpful while cooking.

The video features are pretty good so far as I'm able to ask Alexa to start a movie from prime video and starts playing effortlessly. The music feature with lyrics is very cool too, very similar to Fire TV.

There is a button to digitally disable the microphone and camera, although I wish there was a built in physical shield that I could slide over the camera... for now I'm using a small cutout from a black post it note.

I think it's an ideal product for your office desk, in your kitchen or even in a bathroom for getting news and weather during your morning routine. Overall, it needs some work and it's probably a little expensive for what it is right now, but I have a lot of faith that Amazon will cleanup some of the edges, add some of the little missing features and it will be amazing. If they can bring the price down, I'd probably get one for each of these locations. For now, it's dots all around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_190?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=190&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But it easily COULD BE.","July 8, 2018","I really want to love the Echo Show.  I'd hoped to use this in my private office to remind me of appointments and events. And it could be a great product if Amazon would make some of its standard features customizable. However, the simplest of things are impossible:

1. You can't turn off the Alexa ""Try this"" tips on the home screen. Why? Alexa products have been around for years now. We get the emails with updates. There is a whole screen on the help menu with new stuff to try. Why can't I turn this off on my home screen? In addition, why can't I choose what displays on my home screen? Time, weather, upcoming event is all I want. Considering the ""toggle"" options, this should work, but no. It always defaults back to ""Try blah blah blah.""

2. Why is there not a calendar ""View Month""? Even if it's tiny, I'd like to be able to see the whole month at once, then click on a date to see what's on that day. Instead, Alexa tells me, ""Currently, this calendar query is not supported."" Eyeroll.

3. Is there not a way to control sleep mode settings? This is exactly what makes this product an expensive alarm clock and not an Assistant. I want the Echo to show me my next appointment, which it would if the screen would stay on. Why isn't a user setting?

These are just my issues right out of the box. I'll probably return it and invest in a DAKboard.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Kooiman","Great screen, incredible sound and limitless possibilities","January 11, 2018","I was an early adopter for the Amazon Echo, realizing how much potential was built into the device.  I love it and use it mostly as a ""radio"" for my technophobic mother.  My house is now filled with Dots and control the TV (Dish), thermostat, front porch light and tell us the weather several times a day.  I don't even scratch the surface for all that these devices can do for us.  Now I have the Show and I am in love.  It was incredibly easy to set up.  The screen on it has a very crisp, high quality image.  The sound quality is amazing.  My very picky husband who complains that most speakers ""have no bottom"" and ""small speakers are never going to have any bottom"" sat in amazement and declared ""that's pretty good sound for small speakers.  They actually have a bottom and with my hearing, that's impressive.""

So why get a show instead of an Echo or Dot?  During the day, when you aren't asking her questions or giving her tasks, the Show rotates through headlines.  She displays the time and temp with an icon indicating the weather.  Along with the headlines, she provides you with things to say to her for more information or just fun facts.  When listening to a Pandora station, you can see the name of the song playing and the artist.  If you ask her the weather (a frequent request at my house), she tells you the current day forecast and temperature and then displays a summary for the next week.  Then she displays the current conditions (humidity, winds, etc).  Like to play Jeopardy?  You can see the clues.  Video chat with a friend or loved one?  You can do that too.  Want to SEE Alexa's deals and not just hear a description?  Sure!  Of course, you can control wifi lights, thermostats, etc. just like you can with the Echos that don't have screens but I find the screen to be a great enhancement.

I noticed someone asked a question regarding using this as their alarm clock.  I use a DOT in my room for that purpose but this would work as well.  Just make sure you turn off the camera and drop in features so you don't get caught dressing when your friend or relative decides to call.  You can tell Alexa ""Turn off your screen"" so you don't have the annoying glow someone mentioned.

Over time the number of useful features on the show will grow and it will become more and more a part of my home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This may help vision impaired people by making calls for them or just speaking answers to their questions. Hearing impaired people seem always to be forgotten. Please fix this.

This is something that sits in the middle of FAMILY TIME.  I don't always want a scrolling ""stupid headlines of the day"" feed.  I don't always want an in your face connection to ""the rest of the world"" that I cannot turn off.  The device needs a setting to get rid of the scrolling feed, or to radically customize it to what's actually wanted - the weather, the temperature of various rooms, what's running in the house, etc.  It needs an equivalent of VIDEO MUTE.

Decent sound, loud, clear and easy to set up.
If you're looking for an intercom or video conference device you can use to talk with your family, *run away*.
Video chat setup requires the Alexa app on a phone or tablet.  It steals all of the contacts out of your phone and half-haphazardly smashes them into the app.  There is NO WAY to edit the list or change the names or do anything useful with the contact list. Most couldn't be used for video chat at all, some can but you'd rather not. ""Alexa, Call Mom"" is not an option, unless you NAME your Mom's contact ""Mom"".  ""Alexa, Call Grandma"", same deal... it cannot do it.

I've had one since launch but it has been dormant since then. I ordered one of these for my parents because I thought maybe it would work as a video communications device.

I almost gave this 2 stars because of the prime music that I do enjoy listening to through the echo from time to time but I just could not. When I first received my echo I felt like the issues I was having with the unit answering my questions properly and responding with some sort of accuracy was do to me not phrasing my questions in a way that the AI could understand. I was wrong. Amazon says this system is under constant development and continually learns to better understand you and should become better at becoming a useful device in our homes. Let me say the hardware is just fine, quality screen and the speaker isn't bad either. The problems all come down to Alexa. The AI just isn't ready for prime time. My teenage son, wife and I have all tried to make use of this device and the best grade I can give is an F. Most questions get the response "" I don't know that"" or ""I'm not sure"" or the best one is a short beep sound . If you speak slowly and only ask what the weather will be like today or ask one of the staged questions that scroll across the screen you may actually get an accurate answer, ( well except for the weather,but I can't blame Alexa for the bad weather forecast :)  ). I ask for a Foo Fighters song from my playlist this evening and the only song it would play was Taylor Swift. I will say watching my wife practically jump out of her skin when Alexa starts speaking in the middle of the night when not being spoken to is entertaining for me but is a little creepy. if you choose to spend your hard earned money on this and are disappointed like I am just remember I told you so.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When the Show went on sale for $159 I figured I would pick up a couple and retire one of the original Echos.

The good:
* Does all the things my other Echos do, just enhanced with a video screen
* Excellent sound quality --much better than the original Echo
* The right size for my kitchen counter
* Uses same AC adapter as original Echo.  Didn't have to re-route the cable.
* Good microphone pick-up from all directions -- same as original echo
* Visual countdown timer.  My wife loves ability to see the timer after it's started
* Time and temperature always on. (but where is date/day?)
* Visual calling (like Facetime) to family members with Echo Shows.
* Running slide show of my photo albums in the cloud
* Easy to check on my Amazon Cloud Cams.  Just say, ""Alexa show me the driveway"", etc.

Things I don't care about (may be important to others):
* Watching movies, YouTube (now removed by Amazon), etc.  I would prefer watching on bigger screen, not standing at counter.  That said, it would be useful if it ran all of the FireTV apps for catching up on the news, sports, etc.  You can ask her to play CNN, etc.  but it's audio-only, same as the original Echo.
* Song lyrics.  Yes, it's nice to have the song captions but when I'm listening to music I'm listening, not watching.  This would be a better use for a large screen FireTV, not a small counter appliance.

Things that could be improved:
* GET RID OF THE ""Try, Alexa order laundry detergent"" and ""Try, Alexa tell me a Star Wars Joke""
PLEASE!!!  Put on a switch to disable the suggestions.  I've been conversing with Alexa for over 3 years and don't want the suggestions popping up over my nice picture wallpaper.  This should be a no brainer.  The suggestions ruin the unit's appearance--especially when they're asking you to buy something.  This might be nice for a ""retail display"" in a store but not in my home.
* Tilt stand.  There are 3rd party options, but for this price you should be able to tilt the thing so it's not always aimed at the ceiling.
* Add Date (and day) to the time/temp display.
* Horizontal viewing angle could be improved.
* Audible and visual SMS text messaging.  Why not?  We are communicating all day long with our kids.  They should be able to send a text right to the Show with any phone.

We are totally sold on Alexa's. Our house is full of them.  This unit is a good replacement for the original Echo and would be a solid 4 stars if they just removed the ""Try,  Alexa..."" suggestions that are constantly cluttering the screen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_424?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=424&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It progressively got worse.  I eventually returned it for repair in June.  Amazon was very friendly and the repaired unit worked a couple of months then the same behavior is back again.  Read posts online - it is a known issue/defect but Amazon has not properly addressed it even given how long this has gone on.  It isn't a firmware deal or a fluke - there have been many firmware updates since they acknowledged the ""known issue"".  I will be returning mine for repair again and again knowing each one will probably only work for a few months, but maybe they will come out with a new model that doesn't have this defect at some point.  Not my first choice but I think it is important when you release a marquis product that you either fix it or be prepared to repair/replace it at your expense a potentially infinite number of times. :)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Jones","Gotta Take it Back to Best Buy.","August 17, 2018","Pretty excited about the Echo Show --- until I tried to set it up.  The first thing you notice is there is NOT one piece of paper dealing with setup, troubleshooting of FAQ's.  Nada.  Oh great!  It's plug 'n play!  Wow!

Except, it ain't plug 'n play.  And, I never got it to work.  The furthest I got was a blank screen which said ""installing"" which of course means a device is taking an update.  Two-hours later, the device is still ""installing"" even though its clearly not installing anything.  The family's two I7's and HD Fire tablets are already set up and ready to go, but the device just wants to display ""installing.""

So, it's boxed up and on the way back to Best Buy, this review being an afterthought.  I figured the reviews wouldn't be that hot; and sure enough -- they are not.  I'm computer, phone, tablet, etc. literate and if I can't get the thing working, there's an ocean of people out there with the same problem.  ""Installing?""  Installing what, for how long and for what reason?  A simple update, or is it waiting for an unknown-to-me action, in which case ""installing"" would be an incorrect prompt.

I have no doubt that the device would work marvelously if it could be set up properly, and I have no doubt I could do that if I had written set up instructions and a troubleshooting guide.  But, the manufacturer unbelievably chose to sell a complicated electronic device without the first word of ""how to"" instructions.

I don't always review, but have written quite a few.  Don't think I've ever give ANY device a one-star rating, but this one is richly deserved, and affects my future decisions on whether to buy any other product with the same brand logo.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.
I’d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn’t included that.

My problem is with the functionality of Alexa. The video Playback is rigged with inaccuracies and frustrations. For example, if you finish Amazon's ""Pete the Cat"" series and want to start it over (back to episode 1), it will forever lock on to that last episode of the season unless you go to the website or prime video app. I've also reached out because it's so frustrating that seasons of shows are ""101"" ""102"" etc. It makes it nearly impossible to ask Alexa to play that season unless you get the words exactly right.

It is so useful. We have it installed in our kitchen and it makes looking up recipes so convenient. Also getting quick measurements or conversions on things like cups to tablespoons etc becomes so convenient rather than have to pull up the phone or a computer. With kids it is useful to play music and/or music videos to keep them busy if we are busy cooking dinner etc. And then to start the day by making coffee and asking Alexa to play the news is a great feature. Another great feature is that it keeps flashing trending news bits on the front page that you can ask her to elaborate. Last but not the least i've got it synced with my Arlo Pro suveillance system and my ecboee and it works with both of those things amazingly well.

Don't get it unless on sale!","March 1, 2018","I got this when it was on sale for $179.99.  I chose the white.  I like it but I don't. The drawback (and I knew this going in) is it won't play You Tube. That is the major drawback for me.  Additionally I would like to watch Netflix on the device.  In retrospect I wish I had bought the Dot.  But hope springs eternal that You Tube and Netflix will be able to use on the Show.

I am becoming annoyed with the music Unlimited not being recognized and having to chat with customer service.

Some days Alexa drops and can't finish a simple ap like 20 Questions.

Fortunately you can disable the drop in mode.  That is too creepy for me.  I can see how some people might need this but for me that is not something I want.

I bought this because it is my hope that Google and Amazon can reach an agreement so that You Tube videos can stream.  If you want the ability to play You Tube or Netflix, forget it.  It isn't going to do that.  That is the main reason I gave it 3 stars.

Otherwise there are a lot of  skills available in the Alexa ap. Some are better than others.  The Alexa ""Let's Talk"" really needs work. Right now it is aimed towards a young and I mean young audience.  I am glad I got it on sale because it isn't worth full price to me personally..  Right now it is a novelty gadget and nothing more.  I can't speak about the smart home portion because I don't need it.  I don't buy products at Amazon at all.  If you do you may like this.  Right now it is a great PR tool for Amazon and its products.

If it had not been $50 off I would have sent it back.  I know this is the first generation and with time will hopefully improve.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

-no YouTube access
-uses Bing as search engine

Biggest con, I have used it for about 3 months and the screen is starting to glitch. Started with lines across the bottom of the screen, now has lines flickering up through half of the display. Thought it might be interference from other appliances but problem persists when device is moved.

While you do not have the option to turn off Alexa tips, you can turn off the advertising on Echo Show's home screen (swipe down from top of Echo Show's screen>settings>home screen>home cards>notification switch off).

My home screen typically consists of either 2 or 3 pages. The first page shows the current time and weather forecast through an icon. The second screen shows my calendar appointments for the day. The third screen shows news events or things of interest. If I have nothing on my calendar for the day, that page will not be shown.

Are constant Alexa tips really a bad thing? In my opinion absolutely not! I have learned about so many things that Alexa can do for you from these tips. What good is a device if you are not using it to it's fullest potential? Also the font size of these tips is about 12pt which is not much bigger than the size of a standard line of an email when viewed on a computer. If you were more than 5-6 feet away from the screen at full brightness you would not be able to read the tips. That shouldn't be a problem for most people I would think.

The sound from the Show is every bit as good as the standard Echo. Maybe a little bit better. When listening to music it will display the lyrics for most (not all) songs. If you are listening to instrumentals or songs where the lyrics are not available the display will show the album cover, artist name and album title.

The Echo Show is a valuable asset to my home and I am considering purchasing Echo Spot's for my bedrooms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But when the screen is flickering so bad that you can’t see any of the video or the major functions that the Amazon echo show is meant for, especially only after four months of use I’m not optimistic about keeping this for much longer. I have contacted Amazon to which they continually send me into a loop of Technical Support with them trying to make me reset it without giving me the option of sending it back before disconnecting me and me having to start the entire thing all over again.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_287?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=287&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I realize that Amazon would rather drive traffic to Amazon Music, but considering the flawless syncing with Spotify, that argument doesn't hold its ground.  Apple Music needs to be incorporated.

What a good friend!","November 2, 2018","Would love the new 2nd gen Echo Show and will perhaps trade-in for the new Show. My Show is a constant kitchen companion for nearly everything. Since there are like 17,000 reviews, I'll just add several notes. First, NO YOUTUBE! That was taken down months ago and I have never forgiven Amazon for this cry-baby feud with Google. Youtube was the bomb on the Show; now it's a clumsy workaround and not worth the effort.

I loved Youtube in the kitchen so much that I bought a competing 10inch Lenovo Smart Display. That is a whole other story and using the Lenovo just made me miss my Show even more. The Lenovo has a load of quirks like NO LYRICS (???) and cannot continues a playlist when you stop the device. Also, Google's own Google Play Music service is almost hidden from the Lenovo; it defaults to Spotify - sad. Just avoid the Lenovo.

Anyway, the Echo Show is still the best; lyrics work, Alexa is learning to be more personable, and the 50,000+ skills alone are amazing. Amazon Music is not bad actually, but alas no music videos.

Get the 2nd Gen Show! I know I will (eventually).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Alexa is a great idea.  The Echo Show is also a great idea.  They stop being great ideas somewhere around when you realize you need the EXACT magic combination of words to get Alexa to do something that should be fairly simple like play an Amazon music station on a multi room group.  Oh, and by the way... about multi room groups...

Amazon tells us we can play music simultaneously on multiple devices.  We have three Echo Dots and an Echo Show, a multi room group called 'Everywhere' that includes all of those, and an Amazon Prime Music subscription.  I've gotten music to play on all of them, IF what I want to do is play an offbeat version of a single popular song.  As soon as I try to get the device(s) to play an album, or worse, a station I KNOW exists, it goes something like this:

""Alexa, play the station kids film favorites everywhere.""
""I'm sorry, I can't find the station you requested.""

""Alexa, play the amazon music station kids film favorites on the everywhere group.""
""I could not find a station 'kids film favorites on the everywhere group' on Amazon Music.""

""Alexa, play kids film favorites everywhere.""
""I can't find the album 'kids film favorites.""

""Alexa, play the amazon station kids film favorites everywhere.""
""I could not find a station named 'kids film favorites everywhere' on Amazon Music.""

""Alexa, play the amazon station kids film favorites on everywhere.""
""Sorry, I could not find the station you requested.""

And so on through every possible combination I can think of.  With no luck.

Then, just to give up in abject frustration:
""Alexa, play the Amazon music station kids film favorites""
""The station kids film favorites, from Amazon music.""  (Playing on whatever device I'm next to).

So.  IF what you want to do is listen to the millions of songs Amazon advertises are included with a Prime Music subscription you paid for on devices that are supposed to be easily linked together, this does not work.  At all.  It leads to stressed parents and crying kids.

I'm sure there are any number of other things it does ok, but I have not found a lot that works in a simple fashion.  Maybe Amazon should stick to delivering orders quickly, or work a little harder at interpreting the voice commands better, because this just annoys us to the point where we're considering alternatives.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then, on Prime Day, I thought maybe I did want one for my kitchen, but I didn't want to be impulsive. Then, they were on sale again and I pulled the trigger. The speakers are really good and put out good sound, however there is distortion at volume 10. Also, there is a HUGE jump in volume between 5 and 6. It kinda needs a volume 5.5. I feel like the Show can hear me from further away than my Dot can. It is so much fun.

My boyfriend, who absolutely hated Alexa when I got my Dot, liked the sound so much he wanted one for our master bathroom. So the day after I got my kitchen Show, I ordered him a bathroom Show. (Then I had to order the screen protector with the camera cover!)

I'm not ready to use this for calls yet, because I have concerns about Amazon infiltrating my contacts. But otherwise, I love it and this is my favorite Alexa product. Now that I have 3 devices in the house, I upgraded to the Unlimited Music family plan so we can play different music on different devices at the same time. With the family plan, you can have up to 6 family members and/or devices playing at the same time, so I included my daughter in the plan.

I set up a group with all the devices so I can tell Alexa to play whatever I want to listen to on the everywhere group and hear it no matter where I am in the house. It's also so convenient to be able to drop in on any other device and use it like an intercom system.

I am so glad I splurged on this. I love it and I use it every single day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I found myself yelling like a crazy person trying to get someone’s attention.  I now use a megaphone to yell into her house until someone realizes I am up there.  They have dropped in on me when I was home alone and all I heard was talking downstairs.  It scared the crap out of me.  I thought someone was in my house.  Crazy feature.

Two stars are given for design: it's compact and skeek.

First of all, the screen is small. I cant imagine watching a movie on this screen unless I was holding the device in my hand or on my lap.

Also, and this is a biggie, ourside of a few Alexa Skills, the only thing this can show is Amazon movies. No Internet. This device does not display Internet content. Also, due to ongoing feud between Google/Amazon, YouTube videos cannot be accessed.

Imo a regular Kindle Fire is a far better option. I see why the Show has decreased in price so much these past few weeks.

1. Ethernet port- The wireless works very well, but some people, like myself, love a wired connection. Wired is always faster than wireless.

2. Audio port-The bluetooth works good most of the time. Sometimes it hiccups. I believe it is from interference from other electrical devices,there's a lot in my room ha. If Echo had a dedicated audio port 3.5mm or optical, i would really use my Echo for music alot more than i do now.  I also use my Echo to display my security cameras. It works awesome!

There is no much difference between the echo show and the rest of the Alexa devices except the display to show time, temperature and whatever pictures you upload in your account. You can create family vault pictures, albums etc.
Sound is great and there is no distortion. Definition of the display is very good.
I heard in the past it was possible to play you tube in the device, that would be a very nice feature as well if amazon premium videos were able to be played.

Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.

In this aspect, it has met my expectations with some exceptions. Now one can use echo devices to set alarms using your own selected music or music from one of many streaming services. It's also great to be able to fall asleep to music using the command to set a sleep timer to any number of minutes (or hours) you desire. The sound quality is very good. If you set the screen to ""do not disturb"" it gets dark enough so that it will not interfere with your sleep. However if you say a command while in do not disturb, the screen will light up. There should be a way to disable this.

The device is lacking is in its limited ability to customize its screens. The home screen does not show your next set alarm setting. Since I often need to change my alarm, this can be an annoyance. You either need to ask alexa to show you your alarms or go to the do not disturb mode to view your alarm. The home screen also only shows the first event on your calender, which will remain showing even after the event is completed and is inconsistent as to when it displays the following day's event. There is also a ""Good morning"" screen that displays the time when you wake up but surprisingly does not show the current temperature. Again, I need to ask alexa to tell me the temperature.

Hopefully, Amazon will address these issues in a future update. Meanwhile, I am keeping my Alexa Show.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First of all the speaker sounded pretty bad.  I can hear the vibrations in the speaker when playing on volume 5.  I never had any sound problems  like this with other Echo or Echo Dots that I previously purchased.  Its possible the speaker is defective but it was difficult to find that kind of support on the Amazon website.

I could barely get it to play a video. I was able to get a video list from youtube.com, as per instructions, but the video titles were not readable.  When I asked the echo to play a number selection it did nothing.  I tried several times but had to give up.  I finally did get a movie trailer, not on youtube, to work so I know its not a Wi-Fi issue playing videos.

So I tried to get it to play news videos and asked it to play my video news briefing.  That request would bring up Pandora and play my last music channel.  That happened a few times before I gave up.

Truly disappointing from the experience I had with all of my other Echo's.

Solves a lot of problems with audio-only communication. For example, want to hear deals of the day? No, you want to see them and scroll through. The order by number. Every wanted to know the lyrics to the song. Look at the screen.

Can only imagine this getting better and better, but we have to compare this all the alternative ways currently available. Is this a lot better than audio tools like original echo and all the new competitors? Yes, absolutely. Is this better than doing similar things on my tablet or computer? Yes, it is hands free.

There is not separate volumes for when Alexis speaks to you and the music playback so expect to be adjusting the volume often so you can hear what Alexa is saying if you're like me you listen to music at a low volume especially at night time when sleeping when I wake up in the morning I like to ask her the briefing or the weather but the volume down low from the music so I have to stop her turn the volume up and then start over then when I go to play music the music is blasting loud. This should be a simple fix considering there are separate volumes for the alarm. Another problem no IR lights which means no night vision so if you doing a video or just checking in on a room you have to turn the lights on. Also while in a video call Alexa will do only pretty much hang up or end call she won't turn the lights on or off or do anything else that's a problem no IR light can't see in the dark and can't turn the lights on while in a call. No ethernet port no USB port no SD card slot only one hole for the power cord enough said about that. Also does not work with things that claims it does says it works with ring video doorbell it does barely you cannot answer the doorbell only ask Alexa to see the front door no two-way conversation nucleus intercom does this quite well I was very disappointed that this does not. Nucleus cameras sure you can pull them up but you see them for a second then buffering then you see it for another second then buffering and not even the good type of buffering where you can see an image and it's frozen the screen just goes black and says buffering so trying to make out anything on them is pretty hard unless you have a photographic memory. But still a very good purchase just make sure when you get one to tell Amazon every problem you see in every problem you have so they fix it cuz if no one speaks up nothing gets fixed. Separate volumes FIX IT!!!!

Update sep 19 2017
Dropped another star because if you have let's say three of these and you tell it to call one of the devices it rings them all so no one knows who the cause for or who the calls coming from because the matter which device calls which device it says home calling not the name of the device that you name it. Call Amazon about this their response was to use the drop-in feature I replied if I had kids and wanted to make sure they weren't killing each other in some room other than the one I'm in great but we're all adults here and I don't want somebody dropping in on me in my bedroom with a camera at any time unexpectedly. Come on Amazon use common sense and stop with the one step forward 30 steps back crap.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_354?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=354&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is quite an inconvenience to experience this twice and have to be without the device for the time it takes to ship as well as have to deal with the customer service each time. My whole family purchased these so they could see their grandchild and now we can't even do that since my Show spends most of it's time in the mail.

After chatting with customer service, they will only offer me another refurbished - and likey defective - product OR they will offer me a refund at a whopping 50% of the value!

Alexa is not very bright yet. Often times when we ask her a simple question,  her answer is something along the lines of 'Hmmmm, I don't know the answer to that'.  Hopefully in time,  Alexa will become more intelligent. On the other hand,  she is very convenient to have in the common area for listening to music,  dropping in on friends,  family,  getting weather,  news watching short videos,...  It's nice that she displays lyrics for songs when available.
The one thing that disappoints me about amazon Alexa in general is that you have to upgrade and pay for prime music for each device you own otherwise you are quite limited to what you can listen to. I don't think that's fair. 5 devices in one house and I have to upgrade each device?  If I'm wrong, someone please correct me.

The reason for 1 star - send a message to both Google (YouTube) and Amazon to grow up!!! I love both products. Don't make me chose between one or the other!

Instead of saying ""Alexa"" and seeing a circle of flashing lights - the video screen comes to life.  The speakers are heavy on bass and quite good.  You can, if so incline, pair them to a bluetooth speaker quite easily but these speakers are good enough for any music fan.

Basically, it does everything the Echo Dot does and more.  Although only 7 inches, you can watch videos.  So, it is the next generation Dot but still there are a few disappointments and room for improvements.

I was able to link my AMAZON PHOTOS for the home screen to make it a little more user friendly.  However, no matter how I try, AMAZON ""hints"" keep scrolling across the screen.  It would be fine with me just to see the time and temperature or even the time and date on the home screen but this is not to be and it makes it seem a little oppressive as even the news trends are repeated for hours and sometimes days.

But it is small, compact and if you are getting to the point where you can't live without Alexa for your calendar/ appointments/ shopping and To Do lists/ finding out quick facts from Wikipedia then this is a step up for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also manage to use the two units I have as a baby monitor. However, it misses the mark as far as the main reason I bought it - in order to integrate with the Nucleus intercom system. Although they both use Alexa, they don't talk to each other, so I cannot use the Echo Show to talk to someone else in the house close to a Nucleus. It also only let's me see the front door via the Ring camera, but won't let me answer or speak to anyone at the door.

The listening microphone is not nearly as good at the Echo 1. The Show is in my kitchen and one of my Echo 1's is in the Living Room. The Show responds many times to nothing as though it is listening, but she was never alerted. And when I do call 'Alexa,' she won't hear it but the one in the LR will. Just odd.

I have turned off the constantly rolling calendar and Amazon notifications. I hated those always scrolling through the screen, literally all day long. I wish there was a light in the corner or something to tell me of notifications like the light ring on the Echo 1's. The Show has nothing at all as a subtle reminder.

UPDATE:

I received my new unit and it's fine. Sound quality is consistent with my Echo (which I think sounds fantastic).

I think it still needs some refinement. I don't care to have my calendar constantly rolling through the display. Yes, this can be adjusted, but it's cumbersome. I'd like to set preferences for the 'news' it wants to display.

Sounds Like A 1970 Transistor Radio on AM

Received it today. I listened to the Intro video and thought wow, this sounds crappy.

Tried music. It sounds like I'm listening to a 1970 transistor radio. All audio sounds horrible.

Yes, the issue with Google and Amazon is frustrating, but I'm hoping that they work out their differences. In the meantime, I can still watch Amazon videos and music videos via Vimeo.

I'm a huge Jeopardy fan and use the Jeopardy skill daily. It's my go to timer for cooking and baking and even coloring my hair! I love that I can see the words to the songs I'm listening to, and if I want to know the artist I only need to ask Alexa who is singing the song and she will tell me.

Aside from playing music and setting timers, connecting to my Broadlink wireless remote allows me to control my TV, soundbar and bluray player using Alexa.

One of my few complaints is that a conversation from the TV can activate Alexa, if a word is similar to the wake word (in this case, ""Alexa"").

One major asset over the original Echo is that the Show also has bluetooth support. So I can connect the Show to my soundbar and get even better quality sound.  I can also ""drop in"" from my phone when I'm at work to check in on the house.

It's so much more versatile with the screen allowing you to view the weather, security cameras, watch movies/videos, etc.  There's plenty out there explaining all the features, but the screen is very easy to read in bright light, the sound is very good, it actually seemed better at recognising my voice without mistakes than my Echo is.

The deal killer for me was that it was too bright to use as a bedside alarm clock, even on the do not disturb mode.  If you are a person that wants a very dark room, and you've been annoyed with previous alarm clocks etc. for being too bright, this is not for you.  I bought it hoping it would replace my cell phone as an alarm clock, and it was just too bright.  You can completely turn the display off but then you can't see any clock.  What might help is if instead of having a white clock readout it could be changed to a dark red color on the display.

Now if you have ambient light already in your bedroom, and bright alarm clocks don't bother you, it's not an issue.  It might also not be an issue if if was on the other side of the room in or in a position that was not easily seen from your sleeping position.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen idea intrigued me.  While I do like to see the album art and information as songs play, I found the ""news"" headlines to be worthless.  They were either just entertainment news or news that was old.  No important or breaking stories, so I turnd this feature off.  There is also a feature where the screen constantly shows you ""tips"", as in Ask Alexa this, Ask Alexa that, that scroll all the time.  I find them to be extremely annoying and there is no way to turn them off.  So, when I am not actually playing music, I turn the screen off.

However, I bought it for the main purpose of playing music for me, usually while I am doing something else, such as reading, working around the house, etc.  For this, it is exactly what I expected, having already been part of the Echo family and I do like seeing the album art for the songs, which is, of course, missing with the regular Echo..  I did join the Amazon Music Unlimited and have been very happy with that, as well as Pandora and TuneIn which I use the most.

So, make a way to turn off those annoying ""tips"", and I will give that extra star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Audible works fine, I feel the screen is underutilized realizing it is a platform for Alexa, I understand. Music is really hard to navigate, Alexa tends to try and steer my choices a little too much. NPR is my main beef I can’t pause shows and resume, pausing restarts npr, very annoying 30 mins into cartalk, right before the puzzler. Shows on npr often repeat most times without the ability to skip, the two choices I have are stop listening or listen to same show again.

But over time, I have come to love this device way better than my Google Home device. One thing it's is not; a Fire HD tablet or like any tablet in general. It does not have an intuitive screen, yes you can do some things touching the screen like choose a movie or settings, but it is not going to work smoothly like a tablet, this Echo Show is all about the voice and the voice controlling the device and expecting it to work like a tablet, you will be very disappointed. But if you can see past all that you have an amazing device....

At first I thought Alexa was dumber then google home, as you can talk more naturally with google home and it seems with Alexa, you have to say specific keywords in order to get it to do some of the actions you need it to perform. That part can sometimes be frustrating, as with all the skills I got, it is hard to remember what the exact word is to get the device to open and respond accordingly.  But after the first few days of playing with different skills, I find that I hardly use any of them.

But what I do use and love is the calendar. As I run a business and I like to see my up and coming appointments on the fly, so this is nice. I do not have to pull out my phone and can see everything right there, constantly scrolling on the Amazon Show screen. I also like the daily briefing, every morning I can ask Alexa, ""Whats my daily briefing"" and she will give me a rundown of the day. It is nice to get the most important world and local news, it sort of helps prepare me for my day, so I love that about this Alexa. I also love the reminders, they are awesome. On the fly, I can be like Alexa remind me to do this, or set the timer for 5 min, or add this to my calendar and she will do it very nicely. I have it set up on my calendar where I can see all my bills that are due for the day and it helps me keep up with all my credit card statements, which I love.

But the most important thing I love the most about Alexa is the drop in feature. Most of my family, they live up north, I am in the south and rarely get to speak or see my family up north. Well, I told my sister about the Amazon app that accompanies the Echo Show and asked her to download it and told her to pop in on me. Well she does pop in on me from time to time and I absolutely love it. It feels just like someone coming to your door unexpected, but it is always a nice surprise. You can choose who you allow to pop in on you so it is not so much like they are spying on you. You can choose to turn the device to do no disturb, if you decide you don't want to be bothered or want to put the echo show in your bedroom. But this is by far the greatest part about the echo, which makes it worth every cent. I don't feel as homesick anymore. I even got my grandfather the eho spot, as he is in his 90's and I want to be able to pop in on him and check on him before it is to late.

So if you are expecting like a miracle device, this may not be your thing. But if you are looking for a cool way to communicate with your friends and family and you need a virtual assistant whom you can connect with hands free, this is the device for you and I highly recommend it.

The one thing that is a little disappointing, is they no longer support YouTube. For a sec it came back and then days later disappeared again, and it looks like there may never be youtube on it. So if you are expecting all that, you may not want to purchase. But after a while I soon noticed, Youtube is just a mall fraction of what this powerful device can do and to me it is not a huge necessity, I think I can live without YouTube on this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The main reason I ended up purchasing the Echo Show is because of the integration with Camera feeds.  Mainly the Ring Doorbell Pro, Ring Flood Light Cam and Arlo Q.  All three of these work very well and are pretty quick. I'm able to view a live feed whenever I want since none of these are on battery.

If you dont care about the Echo Show working with the Ring and Arlo products then you can stop reading this review now.

Im not getting any motion alerts on the Echo Show with my Ring Products. It seems you have to be alerted by the Ring Chime or your Phone / Tablet that something is happening (motion alert / doorbell pressed) and then you can ask the Echo Show to show you the Front Door / Backyard to see whats going on.

Im not sure this is a good thing. I guess if you only have one Ring device then you will be fine but if you have multiple then you wont know which device is currently giving you the motion alert.

Ive been leaving an iPad on my nightstand with the Ring app open during the night so when I get a Ring Notification, I could just look over at the iPad and it would automatically pull up the camera feed from the device that was detecting motion without having to touch the iPad or say anything.
The Ring app on the MAC is the same way. If you open the Ring app on a MAC and click the X it wont actually close all the way, it will just put an icon on the top toolbar. So whenever one of your devices detects motion, the camera feed will automatically open to show you. You don't have to click on anything.

With the Echo show on your nightstand, you will need to hear the Ring Chime or the notification on your phone and then ask Alexa to show you the Front Door / Backyard to see the camera feed. Unless you look at your phone to see which device is detecting motion, I guess its a 50/50 chance you ask Alexa for the correct device.

If you do put an Echo Show on your nightstand, you can ask Alexa to DO NOT DISTURB, and she will. This will disable the Drop In feature so people cant drop in on you while in bed. But you can still ask to see the Front Door / Backyard camera feeds.

The Drop In feature is pretty good.  Takes 10 seconds or so for the camera feed to become clear so you can see whats going on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_171?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=171&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, my 1st gen had some screen issues within the first 3 months. Amazon requested that I send it back, so I did... in the original packaging. I was told that it just needed a software upgrade, so they were sending it back good as new. It worked for 2 days... now it won't start at all. I contacted Amazon, and they are sending me a refurbished one. I have no false hopes that it will last the duration of the warranty. I'm hoping the 2nd gen won't be so unreliable...if the 2nd gen gives me trouble, I will give up on these. Also, I really hope Amazon keeps improving these. Would be nice to listen to podcasts more easily and to be able to command the show to play Amazon video via the app on my phone.

You can hook it up easily to your siriusxm account, spotify, Amazon music etc. Its been a ton of fun for the kids who can finally control how to get a song they live by just asking “Alexa! Play the Maui song!” Our 4&1/2 year old son loves to ask for Beastie Boys songs and dance around the kitchen. I can use it to turn on a podcast while I’m cooking. I will say it’s easier to just play podcasts through linking your iPhone via Bluetooth and playing them that way because though the Alexa Skills can access podcasts it won’t fastforward or rewind them and won’t pick up where you left off if you have to come back to it later. I love it that anyone in the family can say “Alexa add cookies to my shopping list” and it’s right there on my phone when I get to the market. The echo SHOW is particularly useful because it scrolls news stories through the day and can play movies and Tv shows and show you pictures and visually show your shopping list etc. I love telling Alexa to turn the air conditioning down since it is connected to my nest thermostat. You can make video calls and WiFi calls. My son can just say call (his grandma’s name) and it will call my mothers cell phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have 3 full-size Echos and 3 Dots, so I am familiar with the Echos. I was expecting more with this, perhaps additional video features will be developed in the future.

Originally, I was going to have this on my nightstand and act as an alarm; however, there is no option to verbally turn off the screen and have it remain off. I can ask it to ""turn off the screen"" (which it sometimes gets confused by and wants to know which device, but does not like its own name, and other times complies without issue - I am from the Midwest and speak very clearly). The screen will also turn back on without my asking it to. Since the screen will not remain off, the Show found itself residing in my home office and displacing the Dot. Given the space in the office and the sound level difference between the Show and Dot, the having the Show in my office is overkill.

Also, I have Nest cameras around my house and I love the idea of having whichever camera brought up on demand. However, the camera will not stay on and eventually the Show returns to the home display. A bit frustrating when I may be watching the front of the house for a visitor or delivery but it stops monitoring.

Finally, I did buy two and was trying to decide what to do with both - one on the nightstand and the other in my office, one on the nightstand and the other in the kitchen, or keep one for wherever and give the other as a gift to someone in the family (my kids could then video chat with their cousins, uncles & aunts, or grandparents that live a considerable distance away. Given the previously mentioned issues, I will not be running into an issue of wanting to buy more to have these placed wherever. The lackluster use limits my options - I think the second will end up being a gift to someone that lacks an Apple product to do Face Time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_111?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=111&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Thanks Amazon!","February 10, 2018","I love Alexa.  I'm all in.  100%.  I've got 14 Echo's of one sort or another.  But have to say the Show is the best of the bunch.  We picked up a pair for $149 each on Superbowl Sunday.  So far I haven't done the video chat thing - not sure I would like that feature even though it seems to be what Amazon had in mind when they invented the Show.  But I like seeing the lyrics of songs scroll by.  I like the way the Show links to my Nest cameras.  The audio quality seems on par with existing Echo's.  What's not to love?  That said, if you don't have a Nest camera or Ring doorbell I'd probably skip this model and get a less expensive Echo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I will say I was impressed with Alexa.
The sound quality on Echo Show is crisp and clear.  I usually have music playing from my bedroom in the morning when I woke up and can hear it well from the bathroom about 15 feet away.  The volume bar is interesting, in my opinion, I feel like the 9 to 10 option is more like 5 to 10.  There's a dramatic increase in sound.

Video quality is essentially on par with that of my laptop with high definition.  The 7inch touch screen makes wonders of this device.  You can adjust the brightness as well and can work as a night light for moments you don't feel like turning on your bedroom light to move around.

WiFi connectivity is pretty solid and I usually have multiple devices connected to Alexa.  I can control her while I'm downstairs and still have a strong signal.

Voice Command, so this is where it gets a bit tricky.  For the most part, Alexa does a good job when I ask her to set my alarm to a specific time or what the weather or any silly questions when I'm bored.  However, for some reason she has the hardest time with music when I ask her to play a certain song from different music programs.  I usually talk to her in a steady normal pace and sometimes she still gets it wrong.

Overall, Alexa has good potential.  The apps that follow with Alexa could be much better as sometimes they do not work or they're quite useless.  Unfortunately, with the dispute between Youtube and Amazon, it no longer plays Youtube access videos on Amazon and that's certainly a downside to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_348?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=348&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the incredibly intrusive and annoying homescreen. Yes, it's so bad that it's worth removing 2 stars over it.

What's wrong with the homescreen? Well, you literally cannot turn off the newsfeed that scrolls across the bottom. Yes, you can go into settings and turn off certain types of news, but you can never get rid of the ""Tips"" from Amazon.

The Echo Show currently has a prominent place in my living room. However, I will not allow Amazon to advertise its services to my houeguests.

GREAT for setting timers if you're into cooking and actually care about not burning/drying out your food. GREAT for a calculator as you just call out the math and she calculates it for you. I've had fun playing Jeopardy!, and yes, you have to type it with an exclamation point! I've used it to suggest recipes, which it then shows you the ingredients and instructions and my family LOVED the mahi-mahi which I made, which means ""strong-strong"" in Hawaiian. I use it to play music by just telling it to play jazz, alternative rock, whatever. I have never actually ordered anything on it (sorry Amazon Echo people).

When you stream from a stationary device such as an echo show, tap, dot, etc, you will not be able to stream music from another echo device or mobile device. I feel that a stationary proprietary device like the echos should not be held against your unlimited music device.

I really did. Having met and fallen in love with Alexa last October when I got my first Echo Dot, I was expecting the same radical change to my household. One of the main reasons this didn't happen is: with the Dot you have freedom to roam around and interact with Alexa, with Show you have to stand in front of it to justify the screen. I'm so used to hearing information spoken aloud to me from Alexa that adding an image to it seems unnecessary. It's a nice product. It does all the things the Dot does plus more, but it's disappointingly less useful. I wanted it in the dinning room, but it wasn't as useful as the Dot. Bedroom was out because even when the screen is off it emits light and any movement triggers it to turn back on. I settled on the kitchen counter where it sits next to my kitchen utensils and the stove. At least here I can ask to watch a video of how to bone a chicken and do the activity at the same time. So far it's working well there and I'm hoping for updates and improvements to make Show more a part of my household.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practical
than using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.

My biggest complaint is the lack of continuity in the platform for each model. For instance, you cannot setup the WIFI on the Echo Show from the app... but all the non-visual models use the app exclusively. The app is sluggish and buggy with UI failures that scream LAZY PROGRAMMING. Then of course, there is the point on the Show where you MUST ENTER YOUR PASSWORD to ""prove"" you are who you say you are. ABSURD AMAZON. I have huge, cryptic passwords that are stored in a password manager and cached in the Amazon applications I use...  to demand the user TYPE this on the visual keyboard is stupid. There are better ways to verify this IN THE APP.

The continuity issues are due to lazy programming and poor design. Do better Amazon. Alexa is cool and *IF* done right, the Echo line can be as cool as it should be by now. You can do better.

I have a pretty big house and some sort of Alexa device in all my rooms.

First- This thing sounds noticeably better then the standard echo. I ended up buying ""Amazon Music unlimited"" because I like the ability to play specific songs and to my surprise, there is a phone app that lets you use it on your mobile.

I also really like the drop in feature. I used it so far to communicate from one room to another. If you have a 2 story house, you will quickly appreciate this feature.

There are some weird app things that I wish were different. Example- I have a ring doorbell and the Show will not notify you someone is at the door. You have to either listen for the doorbell or have your phone with you to see the alert. Once you get the alert, you have to then dial in. Another werid thing is that if you want to see your front door bell and there is nothing there; it will say ""your doorbell is asleep, please wait 30 seconds and try again"". Wished they would just let you see loading and not have to repeat the command in 30 seconds.

Also would be nice if the display would show Nest temps on standby. I have 2 nests and still have to use my phone to see the temp.

Still giving it 4 stars since my only issues with this unit are software based and Im certain Amazon will update these units quickly.

Edit 4/9/2018 - An Amazon customer service rep contacted me due to this review, which I really appreciated. After multiple phone calls and being transferred around, I got to a rep who said ""this is a hardware issue. I'll send you a shipping label to return it for repair."" Great, I said. But I told him I needed them to be sure to note that the popping noise starts after 30 minutes of speaker use. I even wrote it on the return label. I went to UPS, paid $5 for them to package it, and waited. 10 days later, the device is returned to me with a message that ""We’ve reloaded the latest software onto your device, run it through our diagnostic process, and confirmed that it is working correctly.

I tried to be diligent and read the reviews and features, etc. I ordered the Arlo camera and base station package thinking I had ordered the camera with intercom. Wrong! I ordered the regular camera and not the Pro. I thought ok, my error. I returned the camera, and ordered the Arlo Pro camera to replace it, checking first that the base station would work with the Arlo Pro. Great! Now I can hook up my new Alexa Show and use the Arlo camera just like in the ads! Wrong again. After spending two days with both Netgear (Arlo) and Amazon tech support Arlo finally tracked down the problem. The Echo show will not receive any motion alerts from the camera, and will not transmit your voice to the camera. That can be done using only the Arlo app on your cell phone. If you think you can use the Echo show as an intercom with the camera, like I was foolish enough to believe, you will be wrong. So why use the Echo Show?????

Atkins","Another tech toy","August 27, 2017","If you were particularly interested in the Calling & Messaging features, but you don't have a smart phone with a service plan in effect, you may want to consider the regular Echo, as opposed to the Echo Show, at least for the time being.

The following is based partly on experience and partly on Amazon technical support. Echo Show is not a voice activated substitute for VoIP programs like Skype. You will not be able to set up and use some Echo Show features, including calling and messaging, unless you have a smart phone with a smart phone service plan. Flip phones, phones without text messaging, and smart phones without service plans, will not facilitate the process of setting up and using some features, such as calling and messaging. The smart phone must have a recent version of the operating system. I received conflicting information as to version requirements, but Android version 6.0 is supposed to work according to Amazon tech support. The set up process requires entering a phone number to which a text message will be sent containing a verification code which must be retrieved and entered into the Alexa app on the smart phone. The PC and Kindle Fire versions of the app do not support the set up process for calling and messaging.

According to Amazon tech support, the smart phone must be in operation when making or receiving calls or messages. You can only call or send messages to people from your smart phone contacts list who have a suitable Amazon Echo product and who have already completed the set up for calling and messaging, which means they would have to have a smart phone and a service plan. Why use Echo Show instead of calling by phone or by using a VoIP program such as Skype? The only advantage the Echo Show may have is voice activation, completely hands free, which may not be worth the price of admission for flip phone users.

I have not yet discovered a substantive feature of the Echo Show (except those requiring a smart phone) that I did not already have through my regular Echo, Fire TV, and/or Amazon Music. Also, the Echo Show screen can become annoying and distracting, not to mention the energy waste, so I turned off the screen when not in use (most of the time).

Echo Show is still a fun toy, but it could/should have been more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_286?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=286&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good for getting forecast, but many other questions go unanswered, even if we ask a question that Echo Show prints on screen. When it says 'try this:' and we do, Alexa often doesn't answer. The light stays blue for a minute or so, like it is trying to find an answer. Alexa often says ""I'm still learning. I will get back to you when I have the answer."" With all the hype about Alexa, I expected it to work better.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_172?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=172&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It looks pretty when it sits on your table, gives you the time, temp, random news or interest stories which are sometimes interesting. The main thing I use it for is music, which of course you can do without the screen, but you can play amazon prime movies which is nice when I just want something on while we eat a quick lunch. I'm sure there are other aspects of the device I haven't found yet that are also very useful.

However. I think this is almost like a partially-completed product. Many of the ""skills"" (what they call apps) are not optimized to take advantage of the screen. However, this is a software issue that could be addressed as time goes on and more people own the Show versions of alexa. Also (and this is entirely my fault for lack of research) I was expecting a little more integration with regular internet. You can't even play YouTube videos. I get that they are different companies but hopefully in the future they can work out a deal. If you could get Neflix or Hulu on here as well as YouTube, then you'd really have a product that was worth something.

If these sort of software integration things were my only concern, I would give four stars, as it's possible it could be corrected in the future without me purchasing anything else. I took one more star off because I think Amazon really missed an opportunity to put at least one usb charge port on this thing. Another lapse in integration, but this one can't be solved by a software update.

If you're on the fence about the Alexa show, maybe just wait a while. If you love Prime movies (although it doesn't remember where you stopped watching; or even what you were watching, you have to go through the whole thing every time) then maybe it's worth it. I got it on Prime Day sale. I wouldn't want to pay full price for what feels like a beta test run for this product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_58?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=58&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It can't play Hulu, Netflix or YouTube so it's basically a video box for Amazon properties. Mine is sitting on the counter in the kitchen as a glorified alarm clock that occasionally displays a headline that I care about. You (and I) are better off propping our iPads (or other tablets) up and watching whatever we want without restrictions. I'll give it a point for having a decent speaker for something this size but not worth $200+.

****UPDATE 1/4/2018****
Not even an hour after posting this review yesterday an Amazon CS representative called me. He was curious as to what my chief complaints were, which I reiterated from my review above. I know a service rep can't magically make the missing features appear, but Amazon's prompt addressing of my review is a good sign that they are possibly working to remedy these issues. I just wish that the family member who bought this as a gift for me had read the reviews. I'd much rather have $200 in gift cards or something else that I could actually use.

****UPDATE 1/5/2018****
As much as I would love to have faith in Amazon to get some more features and capabilities added to the Echo Show, I have decided to part ways. I'm really not interested in having a $229 alarm clock sitting on the kitchen counter until Amazon improves its functionality. I can't return it so I am putting it up for sale online. If you know someone who'd be interested in a basically brand-new Echo Show and lives in Western North Carolina, check out my Craigslist posting. https://asheville.craigslist.org/ele/d/amazon-echo-show-brand-new/6449167504.html","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_223?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=223&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have an echo, which my daughters kidnapped and keep in their room and I have a dot, and I absolutely love them both.  I was on the verge of getting the spot, when I saw a price reduction on the show.  I had wanted preorder it but was not in a position to when it came out.  Take all of the auditory recreation & educational opportunities you get from the original echo and add the Visual element, the result is a fantastic piece of technology.  It is more portable than it seems.  It has too many abilities and functions to list.

Get one, take the time to truly learn how to use it and stay up to date on new skills as they become available.  It is entirely cloud based, there is no limit to the skills, games, programs etc... that you can add.  It truly is a one of a kind device.

I always said if it had a screen it could be so much more---I'm still waiting for the more part after having the Show for a few days.  Like the original Echo when it first came out, it took a while and some updates to reach potential.  This Show still needs those updates.  First thing to note is that it's not very customizable.  You're very limited with the settings.  You can change the background pics and a couple of the scrolling options, but that's about it.  I was expecting more of a tablet experience, but now as I'm typing this it is more like my Fire tablet where you don't have the same ability to customize like you would a standard Android Tablet.  I'm just very disappointed in the limitations.  I was hoping that you could change the screen to show like a weather station, etc.  Just more options.  As others have stated, there is a constant message that gives you suggests to ""Try"" on the screen.  You can hide this, in a way, by turning off the scrolling and just keeping it on your calendar, which we use Google calendar linked to the Alexa app.  I don't mind the ""Try"" scrolling right now because sometimes it's good to see what other things it can do.  But I could see wanting to turn this feature off at some point....but you can't.....right now.  Maybe an update will cure that.
The next pet peeve was just how to get around and use the thing.  Thankfully, CNET has a good write up on their web page on how to use some of the main features and set up your Echo Show, other Echos and the Alexa app on how to use the camera remotely.  There was little to no guidance on these features and you really have to explore the thing.  I had to figure out on my own to try ""Alexa, go to the settings screen"" to get to settings.  For a while I was trying ""Alexa, go to settings"" and she responded, ""Hm, I don't know the answer to the question I heard"" quite a few times.
I want to say that it seems she can't hear as clearly as my original Echo.  Others have mentioned that many times, the light turns blue and....nothing...literally no response, which is odd because she usually tells you she couldn't hear you or doesn't understand.  But it's literally nothing with me standing right in front of her...er...it..  :)
Lastly, so far, the camera.  This thing is an odd shape to begin with because they didn't put chintzy speakers in it.  But since they put the face at an angle, the camera also faces upward.  So using this on a side table about waist high, when you drop in, you see mostly ceiling.  You can't see anything below about the 3.5-  4 ft level.  So if you are dropping in on your grandkids, well, you won't be able to see them.  I would only see the forehead of my 7 year old son, who is slightly tall for his age.  They should have kept the camera angle at least straight ahead and level and not the same angle as the face.  Now if I want to use it to drop in while I'm out of the house, I have to stack a few kids books under the back end of it to make the camera face straight ahead so I can see kids, pets, state of the house, etc...This seems to me like the developers only thought that people would be standing right in front of it, faces 2 ft away, standing and staring at the camera for this to really work as a ""drop in"" feature...that or they have a preference of staring at ceilings.
So....those are my initial thoughts.  I gave it a 3 which means ""I like it"" which may seem contrary to what I put above, but I bought this knowing there would be updates to help it's functionality.  The 3 is based on my past experience with the original Echo and that Echo growing into our daily usage.  I expect the same for this...except for the camera issue, the fix for that might be some kind of mount that makes it face forward.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_251?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=251&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Maybe seeing the book's cover made a difference. The Show will also read the nonaudio books in your Amazon books library. But I don't use this feature because I'm not a fan of Alexa's voice. I'm planning to use it to help during writing. Things I usually google like synonyms, antonym, meanings, spellings. I also like that any reminders I create flash across the screen along with some headlines. I'm still learning what else a visual person like me can do with it and so far I'm impressed. I just wish Amazon would add more voice options, including male voices like my Google mini. But the Echo Show is definitely a tremendous step up from my Echo voice-only speaker which I rarely used. I haven't used the video call feature yet and the cell phone has to be close to the Show to text, which is irritating and defeats the purpose of brief texting. Also, Echo sends a voice recording along with the text message. This is disconcerting to me.

In screen saver mode, the clock and temperature are large enough where I don't need my glasses to see the time. In power saver mode, the clock is even larger. Considering this could double as an expensive night light,  it was nice to discover the command, ""Alexa, turn off the screen."" As expected, the sound quality of the Echo Show is far superior then the Echo Dot. Initially, the voice recognition is far better then the Echo Dot. I don't need to yell at my Echo Show to activate it. Activation by touch screen was a bonus. I hope no rating updates will follow my initial updates as was needed with the First Generation Echo Dot.

The screen is such a nice addition and I love having the lyrics scroll across the screen when I'm playing music.  I'm sure I'll be taking advantage of all the things I can do with this Echo Show and am so happy with this purchase.  And I don't know how she does it but Alexa just knows me so well and always seems to recommend the best playlists. :)

I have the perfect setup for me with a reasonably priced tilt stand and 7"" clear tabletop Lazy Susan.  It's a very sturdy setup and I'm not worried about knocking it over.  The unit swivels and tilts exactly the way I want for less than twenty dollars.

In addition to my device, I also purchased (on Amazon) an awesome screen protector that includes a button to cover the cam when I'm not using it and a nice silicone sleeve to help me keep my device free from dust, fingerprints, and scratches.

The screen is bright and clear, even from a distance of 15 feet. I like this feature a lot. I can see the screen from anywhere in my kitchen.

The sound from the Show is really bad. Retail price on the show is north of $200. For $150, I can get a Sonos Play:1  that puts the sound quality of the Show to shame. I’m certain that I will never choose to listen to music on this device.

Getting started with the device would be a lot easier, I think, if Show-specific skills were easily findable either in the Alexa app or on the Show device itself.

 At the retail price, this device is too expensive. I bought at a time when the device was substantially discounted. At the discounted price of approximately $125, the Show is a worthy  addition to my Echo family.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I also have an Echo Spot and the screen on this is much nicer and quite large for what it is.  You can do a lot with Echo, and the list of things to do grows every single month.  It seems like a very solid device, though time will tell.

I deducted two stars because of the useless ""Things to Try feature"" that cannot be shut off.  It is barely masked advertising that spoils an otherwise decent device.  There is no way to shut it off.  On the Spot, it can be hidden by selecting to only rotate the home cards once.  On the Show, that is not the case.  This is a common complaint with Echo devices that have screens.  I mean I could set up the device to rotate my own photos, but what's the point when there is some big blob of text going across the bottom of every photo?

If they insist on keeping this, they should allow the option to remove it for a bit of extra $$, like they do with removing ads from Kindles.  I'd pay.  I bet that others would as well.

If I'd paid full price for this, it would already be in the box, headed back to Amazon.  Because I got it for $100 off, I will probably end up keeping it and continue hoping (against hope, no doubt) that they eventually allow the ability to remove this very annoying ""feature"".

Update 12/15/2018 - I didn't realize that I'd already reviewed this and came here to do review it.  I haven't changed my mind about any of the above.  The only thing to add is this thing has a difficult time understanding what's said, particularly when there is ANY noise at all in the room.  If the tv is on, forget about it.  To get it to do anything, I have to mute the tv first.  At many times, it seems mostly deaf.  I'm expecting Amazon to release the Amazon Echo Hearing Aid For Echo Show.  They'll probably only charge $49.99 for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Seriously. What can't this thing do??? I bought two, one for myself and one for my late 80s parents. I know, I know...a lot of folks get all worked up over the set up in two households, two accounts. Not me. They are both registered to me, my amazon account, my unlimited streaming music. I just named one my first name and named the other one 'Parents'.  It was easy as pie!

So here's where the fun begins!! My parents have ZERO technological skills. NONE! The very first day, Daddy sat down and said, ""Alexa, drop in on Dana"" My screen started beeping and there was Daddy!

Yall! This was amazing! Do you realize if he had fallen, and couldn't get up, he could have called out ""Alexa, call Dana"" and I would have instant contact??

This is AMAZING AND WHAT EVERY OLDER PERSON NEEDS ALONG WITH SOMEONE ON THE OTHER END WHO CARES AND WANTS THEM TO BE HAPPY AND SAFE!

The following day, I get a phone call on the telephone and Daddy says,""HONEY! We asked Alexa to play Elvis and she played us one song and it quit. Then we asked her to play a SELECTION and she's been playing Elvis all afternoon!!  Look at that! My Daddy figured that out all by himself!

Over Elvis singing 'I'm so lonesome I could cry"" I hear my Mama holler out, ""I LOVE THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I'VE EVER GOTTEN!!!""

 I asked Daddy to stop the music, and say ""Alexa CALL ...then my first and last name"" It picked up on my cell contacts since I uploaded the alexa app and my phone began ringing. THERE WAS DADDY ON A VIDEO CALL ON MY PHONE!!

 I took him around outside and showed the new roof, the dogs playing, how great their antique bed looked in my guest room. Daddy said, ""This is as good as being at your house!"".

Then I had my Mama do the same. She was shocked! They do not have smart phones so they had never done a video chat before. Mama told me they were having SO MUCH FUN! This means so much to me. They're 87 and 88 and recently moved to independent living. Knowing they could call out to Alexa to call me if they had fallen MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

If you are thinking of getting this for an elderly loved one, DO IT. DO IT!!

It turned out to be way simpler and easier than we realized. I""m not worried about this being on my amazon account. They don't know they can order anything. But if they figured it out, I'd be buying it for them anything so I don't care. This thing should be in every house of elderly folks especially if someone lives alone! Just make a cheat sheet so they can remember what to say!

I have smart home so Alexa shuts off my lights, turns things on when we are not home etc. we had a thermostat installed also and works great to control that. I have no issues, love the emails that tell all the new things alexa does. If you read the directions you should not have an issue with the show or dots.  Thinking sbout the spot for my bedroom and move the other dot to my office. Alexa, make my life easier...

I bought the Echo Show primarily for the video calling / drop in feature, and this feature does work very well. There are a few issues with the device though.

1. No more YouTube. This was another big selling point for me buying the device, but now that it's been gone for a few months with no signs of returning, the value of the Show seems to be permanently diminished.

2. Sound quality. The sound quality was supposed to be better than the original Echo, but my opinion is that it is slightly worse. This may be because the original Echo's speaker was omnidirectional and the Show's is not, but as you move away from directly in front of the speaker, the sound quality is not as good.

3. Microphone. The original Echo also has a 360 degree microphone array, so it hears you equally well from all directions. The Show seems to miss commands much more frequently than the original Echo did, especially when I am off to the side.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Go with one of the other many models.

I don't say the above lightly - I love my other echo's and have driven over a dozen other people to jump on the Alexa bandwagon! The Echo's have been a significant value-add for my family. The Show just falls short for me in a few very very key areas. I've had my echo show since release. I preordered 2 of them, one for me and one for family to conduct video calls.  If we could return our Echo Show's, we would.

Issues:
First, as others have pointed out - YouTube is no longer supported but to us, that feature was kind of hokey anyway. Getting it to find the right video was often a chore - but that's due to my chief complaint - Voice recognition.

Voice recognition on my show is crap. It just is. I don't know what the problem is, but I can say ""Turn on Fireplace"" directly in front of the show, 2 feet away, and it doesn't recognize what I say. I ask it to play a song, and it responds with ""What pandora station would you like me to add?"" Of course, I didn't say anything remotely resembling Pandora. These are commands we regularly do, and have done, with the other echo's. The Show just gets it wrong.

Granted, it's voice recognition issues don't happen all the time, but it's so frequently an issue that it's incredibly frustrating and no longer a ""help"" to use my Alexa. It's definitely the Show too, as my other echo's recognize us without issue. In fact, we replaced one of the original Echo's with the Show, so it's in the same place in the room. For additional context, we have a very automated home - we use voice for lights all the time, and some devices (like the fireplace) as well. We listen to music almost constantly with 3 small kids.

The second chief complains isn't Show specific, but impacts all Echo devices - Calling & Messaging. I have a phonebook full of contacts, 95% of them I never talk to, but have for work, or an old colleague, or a family member I just don't talk to frequently. I have escalation lists for my job, which means some very senior contacts from my very large company. I can't filter any of these out on my Echo's, and with one small mess up can call any of them from any of our echo devices. I only have 1 person I want to call, but I can't restrict who is in the devices contacts. 4 year old is mistakenly heard for calling our CTO? Yup, it's going to give him a call at his house on his family's echo saying I'm calling. How did anyone agree this was a good idea?! To add insult to injury, I can't remove the contacts unless I call customer service!

That said, my kids and my niece/nephew love it when we video call. They all get around the Show and they like playing games with each other and just having a good time (age range is 2-6).

Another complaint which is rather minor is the lack of ability to press a button for the Echo to recognize your command. It's available on every other unit, except the show. You can only trigger the Show with a voice command. It's minor, but it is an annoyance.

I really wanted to like the show. Perhaps it's just my unit that has the voice recognition issue - I hope that is the case. The contact management aspect is crippling the feature and usability though.  Every time I try to drop in or place a call, I have to be super careful with who it calls. I shouldn't have to worry about that! I should be able to only add those who I actually want to call or talk to.

So, what do I have to say that is good about the Echo Show? Nothing specific to the Show unfortunately. All my praise is applicable to the entire Echo lineup. I use it for shopping lists, to-do lists, weather updates, news, music, home automation, dropping in around the house (an internal intercom), and for some of the local store hours / information - though the last feature only works on a few ""mainstream"" stores / establishments. Some of the skills are pretty good, but I mostly use it for it's core functionality.

That about wraps up my long overdue review of the Echo Show. I hope you've found this helpful. If you have, please click the Helpful button below the review - It's anonymous!","2.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So far, it's a disappointment.  I immediately wanted to take advantage of the screen, so I asked for a weather map -- nothing (it just showed a chart of the weather).  I asked for a local map showing mexican restaurants in the area -- couldn't do it.  I asked for the hours of my local bank, expecting a clean chart of the business hours -- nope; instead, I got a link to their website.  Ok, not terribly helpful.  So far, it is not as useful as the 1st Gen Echo it replaced.  Also, the 1stGen Echo had 360 degree sound coming out of it, which was great on the open kitchen counter.  The Show's speaker only points in one direction and the sound is no where near as immersive as with the round 1st Gen Echo.  Overall, disappointing.

That's it.  No additional setup.","February 2, 2018","Now, I bought it at an Amazon store a short walk from my home.  I wanted it mainly to use a a clock radio.  I had to make sure I could easily use the Echo Show to listen to local radio stations and also some not so local ones and that is what I told the staff at the store.  The first person I spoke to at the Amazon store had thought I could use the Show to listen to radio but didn't know how to make that happen.  To her credit she asked for help and the second person was sure I could listen to local radio stations but told me that I had to use the Alexa app and somehow configure it to play the radio and that maybe I had to make a list of stations and those would be the ones I could listen to.  I went ahead and bought the Echo Show thinking that it would be a pain in the butt but I would figure it out and live with it.

To my surprise, upon setting up the Echo Show I just went ahead and asked Alexa to play WFAN radio and it did automatically.  And it played all the stations I asked it to play.  I didn't have to use any apps or configure anything!  So the answer to my question is;  Well sir all of that has already been figured out for you.  All you have to do is ask and you will get any station you want.  That's it.  Just ask.  Nothing else.

I think that no one under the age of forty has ever listened to the radio and that's why I they couldn't help me.  The thing is there are a lot of people closer to my age who buy devices like this.  Maybe Amazon can train their employees a little better.  That all said, I love this thing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_449?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=449&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Did I think I needed it? No. Did I buy it first for my tech-obsessed dad and immediately have envy? YEP. I love this thing. I'm sure everything has already been said, but I'll leave one pro tip here: if you have a toddler who responds better to external timers than mom/dad telling him it's time to move on to the next thing, Alexa is for you! He now asks for a five minute timer before bed and (so far) doesn't have a fit when the timer goes off. I like the structure of it.

We also use the white noise skills on our dot in the bedrooms and kid bedrooms, which are lovely and have an extensive library.

Also love being able to drop in on my parents, but have conveniently turned off drop-ins for us with a perplexed look of confusion every time they ask why they can't drop in on our kitchen.

From the moment we received the well packaged box, to the quick, easy, initial setup; to the every functionality and usefulness of the Show, it has been everything I had hoped for.

I read earlier reviews before buying mine, and the earliest purchasers of the Show said that a lot was left wanting. However, after being out for nearly a year, now, the Show has grown into its own.

This AI Assistant, Alexa, is fantastic. From playing my favorite songs with a simple command, to looking up recipes and emailing the ingredient list to my phone, and ease of use for video drop ins, to the numerous Easter eggs hidden within; Show has been wonderful. I have it placed in my kitchen, so I get my daily update and weather forecast each morning before leaving for work. A reminder on the screen that I set helps me to remember my lunch before walking out the door. And the jokes and joviality of Alexa make it even more personal, and less robotic.

If you’re looking for the next step in home AI, look no further. It’s easily adapts to an even-growing number of Alexa capable devices, as well, making home security and functionality even easier.

Way to go, Amazon. Keep up the great work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But when setting up my device, I noticed how the iPhone and iPad Alexa apps don’t sync, are standalone. So I used my phone to verify his phone number, and tonight all is finally right with the Universe.

I just wish we had purchased this technology last year, when my mother was still alive. She would’ve loved!! the Show’s abilities; and I believe she would’ve heard better than she did using the phone.

The kids love it too as they keep requesting music videos and if anything they cannot spell, they will ask. Overall a pretty good assistant with view.
The negative part is that the screen only stays on until it tell it to turn off when it should have an auto sleep mode like every other electronic device nowadays.

That being said I don't feel they utilize the screen to its max capability. You can't play your Prime videos or Netflix or Hulu videos on that I know of. You can't use other video calling apps like Skype or Google Hangout. This makes the Show only relevant if all your friends and family have an Echo Show.

Though it's not as big a problem but they don't  have a jack/port to connect bigger speakers which I feel is an oversight.

Though I have several versions of the Echo and love their functionality and features I believe they don't meet their full potential because they can't integrate with Google or any of its features. If Google Google decides to upgrade, enhance and/or come with several versions of the Google Home that are counterparts to the Echo Dot, Tab, Spot, Home etc. then Google will make Alexa obsolete because Google and its wide range of free and very useful and practical features and apps such as Hangouts, Earth, Translation, Maps, Streetview (and many others),  with the most basic but important function which is Google Search being sometning makes Amazon's Echo (all versions but especially the Show) much less functional than it could be. For example Google owns YouTube and if you could watch YouTube videos on the Show that would make it amazing. But not even being able search things through Google Search on an Echo device or have those results shown on the Echo Show screen make it a very limited device that doesn't tap into its huge possible potential and it will eventually be made obsolete by Google's own home AI devices.

Lastly the camera shouldn't be so fixed and stationary. For video calls this can be very inconvenient since the screen and camera are at fixed height and in a fixed position. Also glare can be a problem when you can't till the screen to the perfect position to avoid glare from various light sources.

All-in-all I love the concept and all the things all the Echo devices can perform. I love Amazon allows its new features and apps to be open source and that anyone can create a new ability or app for Echo devices. I love how well the show integrates into shopping with Amazon through your account. There are several amazing features and abilities I absolutely love about the Echo Show and other versions of the Amazon Echo. I just hate to think that these devices are hampered by not being able.to tap into Google and I worry that the Echo could lose sales and eventually complete market share to an home AI like the Google Home which literally owns all the proprietary rights to all the Google Apps, websites and abilities that it can integrate into its own AI that will make their devices all the things that Echo devices just can't be due to trademarks, patents, copyrights etc. I'll keep supporting the Echo as long as Alexa is around and the same goes for the Echo Show. But there is definitely room for improvement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only reason to buy it was for Youtube, which Amazon got rid of when they decided to try to control the market by suddenly refusing to sell Google products, but somehow expecting to KEEP free access to Youtube.  The other feature of this that was useful was the video calling.  Does it work?  Is it any good?  I couldn't tell you, because in order to test it you need someone else with an Echo Show, and nobody is buying them because it doesn't have access to YouTube.

It was somewhat trying to set up at first (Alexa wouldn't do voice training, at all), but we've got the hang of it now. We've started to purchase other SmartHome accessories for it as well (some WeMo Switches, which have worked wonderfully for our living room light and our TV), and pairing those accessories with Alexa were easy enough for us to figure out. I don't consider myself hugely technologically inclined, to give you an idea of my experience level with tech.

I think our favorite feature is being able to drop in on our Echo, and to pair a camera with it to monitor our puppy at home.

The negatives: Ours arrived with a dent in the corner. My fiance wanted to send it back, but I persuaded him to just keep it, as long as it didn't affect the technology itself. So far, I don't think it's affected anything about the performance of the Echo show.

We live in an apartment that is approximately 850 sq ft. Alexa cannot hear us from everywhere in the apartment. We have the Show set up in the living room, and can hear us in the kitchen and living room, but not from our bedroom (which is directly behind a wall where the Show is placed). We plan on getting a Dot for our bedroom.

It arrives packaged pretty nicely, and I would recommend it as a gift.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player This is the Echo Show
amazons newest Alexa device
 and if you’re familiar with the Alexa hardware line like the original Echo, the smaller dot, or what seems like an endless line of integrated hardware products that work with Alexa System OS  this device for some might seem like the next logical step for amazon to take but for others it might come as quite a departure from Amazon’s original echo.  let’s take a detailed look and consider the Echo Show, Amazon’s newest device and see if Alexa has a primetime hit with its newest show.

The first thing you will observe about the Echo Show is its shape
 It’s a noticeable departure especially from the original Amazon Echo
With 4 inches of width added to the echo show to accommodate for the additional touch screen its
nearly 2 inches shorter than the Echo while the depth of both devise stayed the same.
The echo show also boast an intel Atom X-5 Processor
Dual 2 inch speakers (which are impressive when comparing them to the original or most portable speakers)
Bluetooth
dual band Wi-Fi support
 and an array of 8 microphones that will be able to detect your voice from across the room

Now the real question is with all this tech what can the Echo Show actually do?
Well for one if you’re familiar with Alexa and how she works, the echo show keeps all the functionality of having a digital assistant but add another layer of immersiveness, functionality and aesthetics to Alexa’s growing list of skills.
For example, of you’re into cooking like my wife or a noobie like myself Alexa can help at all skills levels. For my skill level I used the Echo Show as my timer to keep track of my pizza’s so they don’t burn.  My wife’s kitchen use differs because she can look up recipes from a number of apps hands free, and even can watch instructional videos or look at ingredients lists on the fly.

The Echo Show also has the capability to connect to a number of smart devices to create a more immersive experience in your home. Weather this system works seamlessness is up to the actual devices themselves but in my case, it works well for me…. Most of the time.
Currently I have 2 Ring Security Cameras and a Ecobee smart thermostat hooked up to my Echo Show. The neat thing is once I connect my smart devices I could control the temperature by asking Alexa to turn the thermostat up or down to my desired degree using my set voice commands. This also works for my security cameras which I can view by asking alexa to show me my front door camera, and if I do have someone at my door I can connect using Alexa and communicate through there. One thing I did have to do before anything worked was download my devices Alexa skills and connect my smart devices by logging in but once that’s done its as simple as using the right voice command.
Another feature I loved is Alexa’s ability to play music from a number of streaming services, I happen to use pandora myself. When I do ask Alexa to play a song like a tribe called quest she will get the lyrics and display them on screen so you can try to sing like I do if you want.
Or you can use the Show to catch up on certain cable news shows like CNN. There are several skills that can be enabled that will let you watch clips or listen to the latest podcasts. Or use your voice to control your Amazon fire Tv.
All this requires that you have a Fire Stick hooked up to the same network as your echo show. Now you be able to tell your Echo show to look up for example action movies. The Echo Show will actually display your results on your tv allowing your several options for you to choose from.
It’s also easy to sync your calendar to the Echo Show which will give it the ability display all your important events on screen for you as a reminder, or you can schedule your own alarms. You can even Schule an uber ride with your voice for quick pick up and amazon promises to keep adding more functionality to the echo show.
I also loved the ability to drop in on another Alexa Device. I use this functionality to use the Alexa systems as my personal intercom for my house and you are able to limit who has the ability to drop in on your Alexa devices. In my case I limited it to my household only so I don’t have anyone randomly calling me.
There is a lot to love about the Echo Show but there seems to also be some growing pains that amazon can overcome. For one I would like to see more screen functionality. The Echo show has a relativity large screen but for the most part the only way you can interact with it is with your voice. It would be nice to be able to scroll through headlines on your home screen though this isn’t something that would dissuade me form purchasing the Echo Show it would be a great for some more screen functionality
Also, Amazon need to add major app to their skills to really feel like you’re getting the most of your echo show. For now the video is limited to YouTube and Amazon Prime and even then…… some of the videos cannot be viewed easily on the device. Hopefully this will change soon as it would be nice to be able to catch up on some of my episodes on Hulu while I cook dinner.
My last grievance is that in the next models of the echo show I hope that amazons talented design team is able to condense the device down into a more aesthetically appeasing unit. The overall look and design of the Echo Show are a little bulky and boxy and it would be nice to see a Echo Show that looks as sleek and sexy as its predecessor but also remain true to amazons visions and keep its functionality of a generously sized screen.
All in all I would recommend the Echo Show to any who believes in the Alexa system architecture and wants to have a product like no other on the market. If you’re an early adopter and a patient one you’ll find the Echo show a great piece of hardware. There are obviously some functions that amazon needs to add to make this device feel fully functional. But for now, the Added touch screen is able add an immersive layer of functionality. And for that I have to congratulate amazon for coming out with a product in my mind that in more than a gimmick","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_238?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=238&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Owned a bunch of iterations of Echo's and the functionality of this one is generally the same (voice is the same, video/graphics interface is improving).  The video calling is cool, the fact that is shows a full weather forecast with graphics is neat.  We love playing Jeopardy on it as the questions appear just like on TV.  As with some of the other games there are graphics not just spoken word which we like.  What I would like to see is the ability to change the size and color of the clock in the night.  I want a red color and a larger font, hopefully they add this in the future.  Also I would not use this as a primary alarm clock in case your power goes out (I know the possibility is small but it happens).  We had a similar experience when the 1st Echos came out and I expect functionality to improve as time goes on.  Is it a must have?  Probably not but it is a neat gadget.  You can get 80% of the functionality with an echo do with less and a 1/3 of the price.  Do I regret the purchase?  Not at all.  They will continue to improve the functionality as time goes on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's the main reason I have this thing. It doesn't even natively support it without downloading a ""skill"" as they are called. Similar to browser plugins it seems. The way it imports the devices from Hue and through to homekit is garbage. A lot of what you have created and working will not just work. If you try to organize them in any way in the Alexa app, the next time you have to discover scenes or devices will wipe out all the organization work you attempted to try and get the default import to do what you need it to.

I left a similar review for the skill in the Alexa app. Don't put it on the box and market its support and then leave it to some half measured plugin to accomplish.

There also doesn't seem to be any way to simply play your Spotify (also marketed as supported) library, which is beyond belief to me. You can play playlists, but would have to manually remember to add everything to a playlist that matches your library exactly.

Cool device, but a major function of it is supposed to be its integration to other devices, which seems lackluster to me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_380?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=380&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The display is great but there is very little video content.  The lack of Youtube is a giant fail and Amazon needs to get their act together and start playing fair with Google.  Youtube was a giant reason that I wanted the show and without it, it is basically a clock radio.

PS.  Why can't the timers stay on the screen while they are running?  Having to request it to show the timers every 30-40 seconds or so is a big pain. We should be able to glance over and see how much time is left.  The timers should be included on the home screen as a ""card"".

Over time it started to develop vertical lines across the display.  At first it was mostly during image transitions, when scenes changed.  Now it has vertical lines on every image all the time.  I contacted customer support, and because the device is only 6 weeks out of warranty, they offered me a pathetic 15% off should I purchase a new one.  The support rep was very argumentative.  I complained and got so-called supervisor who offered me a $50 dollar credit should I purchase a new one - the device is listed at $229.99.
I note that there are hundreds of complaints of lines across the screens of 1st generation Echo Shows, and Amazon now has a 2nd generation version.  I have been a customer of Amazon for 20 years and have spent a lot of money with them.  The support for a device 6 weeks out of warranty is pathetic.  The service of their help support, all from heavily accented individuals is argumentative and pathetic.  I asked the supposed supervisor, Anastacia M - she wouldn't give me her whole name - to connect me with someone who could assist me,  She said that there was nobody else.  I asked her to have someone to contact me who could resolve the issue. She said she would pass it on.  6 weeks out of warranty on a defective device where the problem showed up gradually - during the warranty period and that is supposedly the best that Amazon can do on their own product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We didn't really want a wall clock because there is no wall space where it would look good, and the Echo Show looks pretty good for a countertop clock.

We didn't expect it would be so useful -- it's actually a perfect companion for the kitchen.  Everyone in the family has used it to check the weather, watch videos, start timers, pull up recipes, and most importantly, with single device music unlimited, play any song on command.

The voice commands work extremely well even though the device is 2 feet from the kitchen sink.  And we've never had a problem pulling up desired songs or play lists for a wide variety of music from pop to indie, old and new.

My main complaint is that when starting a timer, it only displays the timer for a few seconds then it goes away until the timer goes off.  I would rather keep the timer in the bottom-right corner of the home screen, so you can see it any time rather than have to request to re-display the timer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I find the sound to be a little more treble and less bass than I would like, but it's a minor concern.

First let me say, I am an avid audio enthusiast, it is my passion and occupation. I have heard (and own) many small ""bluetooth"" speakers. I can say this device puts out better sound than I expected. It gets its, nearly 20 watts of power from a Texas Instruments TPA3118 class D power amplifier; as with all class D amps, the louder you play it, it begins to sound harsh. However, at low to mid volume, it really is amazing.

- It sounds great.

Con's:

- Has to be plugged in at all times. Would be Nice if it could be Battery Powered in addition to being plugged in.

- Has to be connected to WiFi to work. Would be nice to be able to use it where I don't have access to wifi like Siri (iPhone) can.

- I don't like that my information and everything I do on it (video chats, my voice, etc.) are all saved forever. That creeps me out cause it's a security issue.

Basically everything went well, a little bit of trouble with learning proper voice commands and Alexa responding to me at first, ""It Takes Time"" for her to get to know us as well as we learning all there is to know about Alexa, LOL...""Have Patience will pay off. I did purchase 2 units, one for me and one for my ""Love Nuggets"" and received a great $100.00 cash discount at point of purchase. I also enrolled in the Family Amazon Unlimited Music Plan and paid $149.00 for one year in advance ($12.42 a month vice $14.99 per month Prime) for this plan and received another great savings. I will be working my way through the many uses, lighting controls, Nest Heating and Cooling Thermostat controls, Cameras, door locks, etc.- etc. to take full advantage of the Echo system as it expands with function, gadgets and services. The screen is a bit small but very sharp and easy to see from a distance, speakers are very good but hope one day to be able to control the Base & Treble to personal taste! I do bet Amazon will be developing a larger screen and a more expanded system later on as the demand increases across the board. In working out the bugs and swinging through MY Learning curves, the awesome Amazon Echo Customer Care/Support Dept with a direct line (877-375-9365) to reach a real person has been worth this Venture! I highly recommend this product, not only as a leading edge Gadget that is fun, but also it is informative and has a real life functionality! that is helpful, even for my age at 74... but at a slower pace, I do get it Kids!!

I believe honestly that this investment has been worthwhile and fun at the same time!!  I will up-date this review when I expand the Echo presence in our home and with all our family, stand by folks...

Thank you Amazon and the Echo Support Dept.for your 5 Star Support

Turns lights on/off, turns the thermostat up/down and reports the temp in the living room. I love the drop in feature, it's perfect for when our dog is at home alone and I know he's lonely (which thankfully isn't very often) and to talk to my kids when I'm at work and they're off school. She also works great with our Blink cameras - we have one on our front porch and I can easily see who's at the front door without having to open it or even get up, which is especially nice at night or when salespeople come by.

She can also do the basic stuff (weather, temp outside, play music, videos, etc) but she doesn't seem to understand as many questions as our Google Assistant. I do like Alexas repertoire of her own songs though, I actually play ""It's raining in the cloud"" a lot-lol!

I'm glad we chose this on Prime Day, I don't think I could have afforded it otherwise. I love being cozy in bed and seeing the bathroom and hallway light on AGAIN (kids never learn) and instead of having to get up to turn them off for the 15th time that hour, I just ask Alexa to do it and it's done! I paired her with our Blink cameras, Sengled light bulbs and Nest thermostat and all work great.

In addition, Alexa doesn't know the answer to many questions including what she can do.  I'm continually referred to the Help section of the guide.  I asked for a list of people who sang a particular song (Google gave me 4 artitsts).  Alexa didn't give me a choice.  She said Mel Torme and then began playing the song.  I asked for a list, not to play the song. I understand that I'll need to pose my questions in a certain way but I don't think it's going to get better.

It has been an absolutely amazing device.  I use it often to help me with my spelling when writing.  The characters coming up on the screen is a very attractive feature.  The calling feature is so attractive that I decided to purchase these for each of my sisters, who live far away.  I call them almost every day, as I previously did so with my cell.  I use it with my Nest thermostats to turn up and down the temperature.  I control my Dyson fan and air purifier over and over all day long.  I look for movies, and review the trailers on the device whenever we head to the movies.  I get news releases on it all day long.  I use a background picture of my family on the device, so it is as having a photo sitting there on my desk.  I occasionally will listen to music over the Echo Show, but do this more on my other Echos, as I am often on the phone in my library.  I use it all day, every day.  It is very futuristic, and incredibly useful.  I recommend the Echo Show VERY highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mean if you show me a picture of something and I ask you about it, or request more details it is really annoying to get a standard I don't know that,  At the bottom of the screen it flashes a sentence, but unless you are paying close attention and can read the exact sentence back it offers you either an I don't know response or info that only vaguely relates to the screen in question.  Either make the key word sentence bigger so you can read it, or stay on longer so you can exactly quote it,  or finally how about being able to return to previous screen,  Perhaps this is one of the reasons we seldom look at the screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The show does everything that its predecessors do, so I won't go through the audio features.  After figuring out how to setup contacts using the Alexa App on my smart phone,  I've been able to use my phone to make video calls to my family from wherever I happen to be.  I was on a business trip in Brazil for a couple weeks this month and used the App to call home regularly without problems.

The Alexa App lets you choose which camera to use.  The default is the camera facing you, but by touching your picture on the screen you can switch between cameras.  I was able to show my family sites from Brazil while talking to them.  I've noticed that my kids like to get in on the call when I use video.  When I make a regular phone call it's usually just my wife that I talk to.  Hopefully it isn't just the newness of the Show that has them participating.

My wife says the audio cuts out sometimes when I call from work, both here in the US as well as Brazil.  However, the problem hasn't occurred when calling from hotels, so I think it is related to my work network.

We bought a Show 2-pack and shared the savings with my wife's parents.  The one snag we've run into, which can be a big snag, is that in order to set up contacts for Alexa-to-Alexa communications, both parties have to have smart phones (or cellular service on a tablet); this is how Amazon links accounts.  One of my wife's parents has a smart phone, but the Android OS was only 4.4 (the other parent has a flip phone).  For contacts, the Alexa App only works with Android OS 5.0 and above, and iPhone 9.0 and above.  I called Amazon and confirmed that this is why we could not set up contacts on their end.  Fortunately their son lives with them and has a compatible smart phone so we were able to setup contacts.  Since the main incentive for many existing echo/tap/dot users to get the show is for video calls, Amazon needs to include this critical information in the main description for the product.  Many people, especially elderly, don't replace their cell phones every two years so that they have recent OS phones (if they have them at all).  Hopefully Amazon comes up with another way to link accounts in the future so that the cell phone requirement can be eliminated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_281?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=281&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a Show, Dot, Echo and Cube in my home, I have completely bought into the Alexa home.
The problem is Amazon forces ""updates"" that break things that used to work. I get home tonight and the app has changed. My lights randomly respond to commands. All of them worked fine before the update and they and they work fine with my SmartHome app.
If Amazon is serious about being at the center of my home, they MUST test releases and allow customers to control updates or revert.
I am extremely upset. I have some lights that I can't even get to except through the app and now it doesn't work.

UPDATE:
Amazon customer support quickly responded and fixed the issue. My house is  all working again thanks to incredible customer support. I am back to loving my ALEXA again but like any good relationship, I want to improve my partner ;-)

Why not 5 stars? Here is why -
 1. Please get someone that actually cooks working in the development team and set up default configurations i.e. kitchen, living room....
 2. When I look up a recipe, keep it on the screen. It is EXTRA annoying to have ""helpful hints""  (see 6 below) pop up when I am trying to read a recipe.
 3. In the kitchen I want to watch the timers, so please keep them on the display so I can see how much time is left.
 4. Make timers available on all devices, i.e. if I start a timer in the kitchen, I want to know how much time is left from the living room.
 5. Related to 3...Sometimes a timer setting is picked up by one of my other devices and then I can't get access to it from the kitchen.
 6. Stop running the nuisance ""hints""
 7. Add a command to Routines to turn off music
 8. Do not claim that a Fire cube is like another ALEXA when I can't add it to my ""everywhere"" music group. Double penalty here due to advertising it an ""all in one entertainment experience"" when it doesn't stream with other ALEXA devices.
9. Bonus points if Fire devices would play ""everywhere group "" music through my TV audio. Oddly enough, I have chosen to attach my best speakers to my TV. I suspect I am not alone here.
10. Even though my Cube won't join the ""everywhere group"", it pauses whatever programming is on the TV when I send a command to any ALEXA device in my house. For example, even though I can't listen to the same music as the rest of the house, my family room TV gets interrupted when someone sets a timer in the kitchen...then I can't access the timer from the family room!

Like I wrote above, I am very committed to the whole Amazon Home Automation environment. It has greatly simplified my life and is usually reliable and convenient. I will continue to add more devices to my home as time and my budget permit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My parents hardly know what a cell phone is much less a smart phone. The Show has no way to create a contact list without a smartphone. HUGE design flaw. It should be an easy fix and I have seen others complain about the same issue. So far no response from Amazon other than ""we're looking at it.""

If she forgot to hang up the phone after someone called, I'd have to drive over which added 20+ minutes where, if there was a problem, help wasn't on the way.  I have drop-in enabled on the echo show and its placed in a central area of the living room (I have a few other echo spot's placed at her house too).  When the phone is off the hook, I just do a drop in from the echo show on my desk at work or at home (this has happened more than once) and tell her the phone is off the hook.

I don't think it was designed to be a watch dog, but it works great as one (I have an echo spot pointing at the inside of the entrance as well as a ring doorbell device outside the door to help too).

It allows me to check on her instantly (which is very handy)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It can do all the awesome things your standard Echo does, but I find little reason for the screen. There is a time display, it makes Jeapordy a bit cooler by displaying the questions on the screen in classic jeapordy format, and it can do a few other neat things like that. I do recommend you research for yourself because I’d hate to undersell it but that’s my experience. Unfortunately, it does not play YouTube, which alone would make it 5-star for me. I love watching my favorite podcasts and looking up Tasty recipes on YouTube, and thought this would be the perfect device for my kitchen so I could enjoy those things while not in front of a television or computer. Of course now I know, Amazon and Google are at odds, so unfortunately for consumers the screen on the Echo Show has very little useful utility, speaking for myself at least.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_146?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=146&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The music function is really awesome. If we say “play songs by [artist]” she plays music only by that particular artist.

My kids 5,4, and 3 have also learned to ask Alexa to set a 10 min timer when it comes to sharing a toy. Playing music is nice and we also like playing games like Jeopardy when making dinner. The kids love jokes and songs by Alexa. The shopping list feature is also a favorite because with the app myself and my hubby can always see if we need something when we are out an about. We had a pet that needed meds for two weeks 2x per day so to have ongoing reminders was really nice. We have plans to purchas a spot for the bedroom and an outdoor camera.

I wasn't sure about a screen being necessary, as using your voice was the whole idea behind the echo, and I believe that is what has made it so popular. However, after having the 'show' for a couple of weeks now, it's totally sold me. It resides in my kitchen (which seems to be the most logical place) and has become so helpful. From setting timers ( you can watch them count down on the screen) to looking up recipes (Alexa will read them to you while displaying on the screen), to playing music (title and artist are displayed). The screen is clear and has good color. I've been updating my house with smart devices, and the 'show' controls them along with my other echoes and dots. Lights, thermostat, cameras. I really like that I can just ask Alexa to show me one of the camera views, and there it is on the screen. No running to get my phone or iPad to use the device app. The drop in feature is helpful and fun too. I bought my parents a 'show', and they love that feature! lol. It allows you to activate one of your contact's 'show' screen (drop in) and video chat. (it will warn the person you are contacting, that you are 'dropping in').

I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can’t use the Show with the CloudCam—and then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem.

There are pros and cons about the Echo Show. One of the pros is I can video chat with friends that have Echo Show, Echo Spot, or even the Alex app on there phone. But one of the major cons for me is the command response of the Echo Show compared to google home. The response from google home was much better than the Echo Show. For the most part, I could say a command only once with google home and it executed the command, I find with Echo Show I have to repeat the command a couple of time before any response.

Save your money!","August 29, 2018","I have given this flashy piece of tech garbage over a year of my patience. It is not only the worst-performing Echo (I own 3 Echos, 4 Echo Dots, and a Echo Spot alongside this Show), but the terrible OS and User Interface handicap this thing’s potential.
Specifically, the microphones on the Show are far less accurate or responsive, and I find myself almost always repeating myself multiple times (Alexa is hard to even trigger at a close distance).
Bezos made a pathetic mistake by shoving out Google, as this Show is no longer YouTube-enabled, foreseeable until these CEO children stop bickering over more and more control/monopolized sheep.
Also, there is no way to simply “load” an app (like Prime Video) and use the touchscreen for navigation/control like a smartphone/tablet, making it quite pointless and unusable, especially without the secondary use of an iPhone/iPad to find what you’d like to stream EXACTLY as titled by request of Alexa (who’s typically way off, and starts automatically playing nonsense).
The speakers are just fair, and easily surpassed by a cheap Bluetooth speaker for music.
I had desired to use this as my YouTube box for streaming random videos, but that’s kaput, as any non-Prime video request results in a terribly-rendered Bing Video search result. I find the ONLY thing I consistently or reliably use this countertop-wasting-box for is to watch Routers TV, the absolute best and simply-consolidated news stream compilation each day (Download the iOS/Android app now for your new fix, it’s IDEAL!).
Pandora and/or Spotify music streaming is inconsistent, especially when paired in a Echo whole-home group, which is the very reason I bought all these Echo’s. The music will 1) refuse to play on some speakers, randomly/inconsistently, 2) Stop playing after one song or after another random duration, 3) refuse to resume playing, and most aggravatingly 4) Play something completely different from said request. I realize some of these grievances are not unique to the Show, but as I said before, it’s the worst-performing and thus least-utilized/realiable Echo out there. Save your money, this box is not worth wasting your time simply for a terrible version of the Echo with a small screen.
***************UPDATE*****************
Now 4000% more useful! Changing my rating. As of 10 Oct 2018, with the new OS update, YOUTUBE IS BACK! Amazon finally introduced the Silk & Firefox browsers, allowing this to be basically a hardwired tablet! Finally, an always-on, kitchen-based, communal “tablet” for browsing the Wide-World Web, namely streaming YouTube, the end-all-be-all video source. The usefulness of this subpar Echo has increased tenfold with the ability to use a browser and login to YouTube!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My show is now 5 months old and no longer works fully.  I would not invest in this product.
I have emailed Amazon twice with no responses in return.  I would give this product zero stars.

Original review.
I have never left a review before on Amazon.  I am giving the Echo Show 2 stars because it's a great sleep machine and provides some good ambiance sounds.  It is also a great alarm clock.

However, it is not worth the $230.00 I paid for this at an Amazon store in the mall.  Echo Show is not very user friendly.  Alexa does not know a lot.  In order to get information you want you have to open all these skills and most of them are like basic apps that were developed years ago.

Overall Alexa is fun to listen to music and very basic things.  The Echo Show provides the basic smallest amount of information when asked.  I am amazed that Amazon would release a product so simple and not ready to be fully utilized to its potential by consumers.  I have a feel Google will blow the Echo Show away when their version comes out.
I was foolish enough to purchase 2 of these; one Show for me and one as a gift.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Good Sound","July 17, 2018","I was really pleasantly surprised by this. I expected the screen to be smaller and I didn't really think about how it stood up (It's a wedge ... a nice sturdy wedge). Originally, I intended it to go in my bedroom, as a replacement for my Spot. It was a little too big for that. So, I moved it into my kitchen.

I love being able to stream shows while I'm cooking. I love that I can see recipes as I'm cooking.

The sound on it is really good ... lots of bass. If you have Prime Music, it will show the lyrics as well. I don't need help singing though *wink*

I was so impressed with it, we bought another on Prime Day for the living room. I don't have a television in there (because I feel like people should be there to visit, not to watch tv and wipe Cheetos fingers on my couches), but I thought it would be nice to have a Show in there. This way, we can stream shows and it's not obtrusive.

The one thing that I'll mention and this is just my experience is that the more expensive the Echo gadget, the softer you need to talk to it. With my parent's Dot, I literally scream at it across the room and it picks up. My Spot, I have have to be a bit closer and not scream. The Show doesn't seem to pick up across the room and seems to respond better if I just use my inside voice with it, close to it. It could be where I have all my devices but it happens enough I thought I'd mention it :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_175?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=175&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Your Alexa needs time to recognize your voice, when you are loud, accent, sick, or you speak low.  I purchased this for my parents.  It's helped them in so many ways, reminding them to take pills, exercise, to call me drop in...I have one as well and I can see them and actually see how well they are doing.  They can read there subscription name to Alexa and she will tell them what that pill is use for...so they take the right pill.  They can now set their calendar up using Alexa and clearly see day to day events.  I still call to remind them, but I get a big kick when my mother tells me she knows...sounds like me when I was a kid.  They can listen to their music from the past at anytime.  They love the jokes and they love giving commands to Alexa to turn on or off their lights. (need to buy the special bulbs which you install and pair up with Alexa).  My parents are both over 75 yrs old and they were hesitate, but quickly picked it up.  My dad had problems saying Alexa because of his stroke.  So, I changed it to Echo and now Echo has no problem recognizing him. (you have four choice to choose from, computer, Echo, Alexa, ?)

Youtube is horrible unless you know exactly what you want to look up. Mine is in the kitchen. It's great for cooking, listening to music, getting the news and everything else you would use your phone for in the kitchen but completely hands free. It does have a problem picking up your voice if you have the volume on 10 while listening to music but the device gets loud so it's understandable. I had a little problem with mine out of the box and tech support was amazing. Fixed the problem within minutes and noted it so if the problem happens again it will be able to return out of the warranty. Best buy ever

Update: my show is a gen 1 a few months into owning it my volume button went out.
Not a big deal I called amazon and was told that I need to send it in then they will decide how long it will take and if they can fix it. I ask if they can just send a new one since I reported this issue right out of the box the first time and was told that no. Because they dont have any because they no longer make them. I was issued a refund.......super disappointed. Now I have to fork out an additional 100 bucks to get a new model that does the same thing mine already did. Sucks","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_76?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=76&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Two *major* improvements this would benefit from: Make the screen operate a lot more like the Kindle Fire, and Add a Battery. It lacks the versatility of tablets, and it lacks the portability of Bluetooth speakers. Moving room-to-room means boot up. If I could do it again; I would buy a Kindle Fire with Alexa, and a Bluetooth speaker. Together, they'd be about the same as the sale price. No way I'd pay $229...

Hammer","Alexa: unfulfilled Promise!","November 24, 2018","The Show can be handy in the bedroom for controlling lights.  BUT there are MAJOR disappointments:  (1) I paid extra to NOT have advertising but I can’t seem to turn off the non-stop flow of useless « news » and « information » about skills and capabilities that are of no value to me.  I especially don’t want to be told about the personal life of celebrities and sports figures.  I am not interested in spectator sporting events.  And I don’t choose to be told about all the unwanted things I could have if I joined Prime; I am just not interested.  (2) I do want the Echo Show to broadcast a continuous video feed from my Nest Hello video doorbell.  But I must ask for this display and then it shuts off after an Amazon-predetermined time.  To get what I want, I had to buy a security monitor, a Google mini and a Google chromecast dongle.  Too bad that Amazon has decided to pre-empt the useful with their display of annoying and useless on-screen babble.  (3) Alexa is programmed with useless information.  If I asked something stupid like Kim Kardasian’s birthday, I would instantly get an answer but I don’t care about such mind-numbing trivia.  But if I asked Alex a question like »who was the king of England when the Mona Lisa was painted? » all I get is irrelevant non-sense or an admission that she doesn’t know.  For now Alexa is good for little more than turning on and off the lights.  No, I don’t want Alexa to tell me a joke as her AI is a joke.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you live with only Amazon services, this might be OK.

Controls only a limited selection of ""smart home"" devices (not my thermostats, security system, or switches).  Must be plugged into AC to work.  As it is, this is a fun toy for kids or those easily amused--for a couple hours.  All in all, the list of things this can't do, compared to a basic tablet, is many times longer than what it can.

Before I set it up, I thought it might also be a good gift, so I bought one at a local Target store.  Big mistake.  Now I'm going to have 30 days of questions like, ""How can I play my iTunes?"" ""Where is Netflix?"" ""No You Tube?"" ""How can I get my email?""

For such an expensive device, it is lacking features. Lacking sound quality. No YouTube support or anything (apparently it was taken away) groups and multi room listening doesn’t really work well, not as robust as you might like.

Then there is the quality.
Screen flickers occasionally, reboot seems to solve it for a bit then it happens again. Tech-support can solve it and suggested replacement.

 Here’s the kicker. With just these issues that have listed it would probably be at three maybe four star review, especially considering it’s a newer items. But when I went to get it replaced, they want me to send it in to get repaired. This is supposed to be a smart home device, Where I am controlling things in my home with it, and without it my home controls are no longer working. Since their device is not bein where I am controlling things my home with it, and without it my home controls are no longer working. Since their device is not designed well, I have to go without smart home control in the mean time because they sold a sub par product. This is supposed to be a $200 plus item, doesn’t seem to be worth that price.

They have an express replacement option where they send you one first but they want to charge you for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_245?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=245&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Functionally the feature works as advertised, but the physical design of the device is NOT with little people (kids) in mind, since when it is placed on a flat surface the camera is directed upwards into the ceiling hence for 2-3 year old to be seen with the camera they have to get up on a chair, or the device has to be placed on the floor - neither is acceptable. Also, if you tilt the device for the camera to point down then the screen is in a suboptimal viewing position - also an awkward experience to speak to the person who is dialled in. One easy way to fix this is to design the device with an adjustable camera angle.

I was so looking forwards to a solution for my parents to drop in...  Hence I'm equally disappointed... Once Amazon fixes this I'll bring the rating back to 5 star, since otherwise the device is awesome.

Alexa (voice of Echo) is always ready to answer questions that you have, turn on your smart devices such as the Nest Thermostats (sold separately)and monitor the children’s room with a compatible camera (sold separately). One of the nicest features is how the outlook calendar can be synced so you can review your meetings by simply requesting it! The device itself is made to last and the speakers in this unit are very impressive with crisp clear sounds when you play your music. The Echo show does so much and the features keep being added! I love how simple it was to connect to the internet via your home router. The Show also has a monitor to view news highlights or to show your photo album.

This has just reduced the Show to nothing more than a dot with a screen where you can READ what Alexa says but she can no longer ""SHOW"" anything. No wonder they are offering $100 off. They know that the Show is not worth more than $49.99 if it can't ""show"" any videos. Sad. ***Update 9/28/2017: My 3 Shows are now worth less than 1 star.  Aside from not being able to watch news videos, recipe videos, or any YouTube video at all, now it seems that Phillips Hue lights are no longer working correctly with Alexa. What's next? I have 3 of these and if the issue is not resolved 2 will be returned (still within return period). The 3rd will just be taking up space.

It has revolutionized my mornings, alarms, reminders, schedule, and music. It is so easy for me to get my news while making breakfast and not having to have my TV on full volume to hear or constantly be looking up from what I am doing. I can have this sitting on the counter and take quick glimpse to see what is relevant from a selection of news sources that I pick. No more changing channels or constantly searching the internet for the stories i want from multiple news sources because I have already selected them on my Echo. I do not have to worry about setting alarms because I can just tell Alexa to do it and I know its loud enough because the volume is up all the way for alarms but not for everything. I can give her reminders and ask her the traffic situation so I am never late to events or to switch over my laundry. My life feels more organized because now I have my own personal secretary reminding me what I need to do and I no longer need to go through my phone and input it into a calendar which is a hassle. Also when it comes to music it is 24/7 ready to go. No more leaving my phone plugged in next to speaker where I cannot conveniently use it or dealing with connecting to Bluetooth speakers. This is an all in one package. As a bonus you can now call all your friends that have an Alexa and talk to them or video chat if you want which is way more convenient than paying for a landline.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The most frustrating part is not knowing if/when Amazon will fix the YouTube issue with Google after Dave Limp admitted Amazon customers are the ones being hurt here, and that Amazon is ""committed to fixing it"".

Amazon - Where are we at with working towards resolution?  As a loyal and long-time Amazon customer, it's no fun being caught in the cross-fire of a turf war.

“It was a surprise to us,” Limp said, following an event in which Amazon introduced a series of new devices, including new iterations of the Echo. “We don’t love it, on behalf of customers. We think a lot of customers were using YouTube on the Echo Show and liked it. What I’ve said to Google is: just tell us where we weren’t compliant with the API and we’ll send a team down to Mountain View tomorrow. I’ll send one tonight! And we’ll get the product back in line. They just haven’t told us what’s wrong with it. We’re committed to fixing it.”

Google named what needed to be addressed to resolve it. Time to play nice and get us back the full featured product we loved.

Thanks,
MD","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_108?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=108&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hood","Entertaining, but still needs some work in practicalities","September 14, 2018","I purchased two of these so I could have one on each end of the house (master bedroom and my office).  Primarily, I wanted to be able to use a video intercom between the rooms.  For this purpose, it works pretty well, although it is a bit slow to resolve the video feed into something recognizable.

The built-in audio is very good, and falls on the higher end of the scale between the Dot and the (original) Echo.  Not surprising or unexpected, since it wasn't designed to have ""room-filling"" audio like the (original) Echo.

The single-device aspects of its practicality are very good, with the ability to display a decent range of information.  However, having more than one of these devices limits its usefulness in practical terms, because you cannot separate information on a per-device basis.  For example, I configured my Office Show to display my business calendar, but the Master Bedroom Show also displays these calendar events, where it really isn't practical.  From what I can tell, you cannot configure devices independently (by setting up multiple profiles on the same account), so be aware of this if you want to purchase multiple devices and have multiple people use them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Until then, I cannot recommend this to friends or family.

Pros:
-Great video display & sound
-Ability to talk to relatives far away
-Easy to use
-Simple set up
-Fun features, news, weather, lists, music
-Durable and easy to clean
-Sleek, attractive
Cons:
-YouTube is no longer available on the product.  This is a big reason I dropped this from 5 stars to 3, along with other technical bug issues.  I watched a lot of youtube videos to help me cook, to entertain and teach my child, to watch music videos, etc.  I didn't realize how much I used that feature until it was gone.
-Unexplained bugs.  Videos often cut off in the middle of playing.  Alexa features topics to ask her about, but when you ask about them, they only work half the time.  I have had several issues with the ""facetime"" application of it freezing the picture, but you can still hear the voice.
-She often doesn't understand requests after repeating clearly several times, even simple requests we make daily.
-Amazon customer service has been little help.  If I email, they request a phone conversation, which usually goes no where.  I have had two calls, both with a thick accent that made the call last twice as long as it should have due to the fact I had to have the rep repeat every sentence at least twice.  After an hour on the phone, nothing got resolved and I hung up completely frustrated that we both could barely understand each other.
-I purchased this with a relative to use the facetime feature and my relative has all of the above issues as well, so it's not just my show unfortunately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_85?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=85&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At its default setting, the Show is basically a direct channel for Amazon to advertise to you. And after you've turned off all the ""content"" settings, and even after you've turned on ""Do Not Disturb,"" Amazon will still push ""suggestions"" to you constantly, 24/7.

These suggestions at first appear ridiculous, and aimed at first time users, but you can't ever turn them off. Why? Because interspersed among those pointless suggestions are advertisements (e.g, ""Try asking Alexa to show you our latest Prime TV show!"")

If this had been marketed honestly, it would have warned people that it comes with ""Special Offers"" that you can't turn off. That alone would have kept me away. But they didn't, which makes it even worse.

As an Amazon customer since the 90s, I no longer recognize the company it is today. I'm done with it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a half of a year the show started making popping noises when listening to audiobooks every 10 seconds, and between segments in any audio.  This is probably the biggest issue.  But another huge flaw is that when listening to podcasts it will replay 5 seconds of a segment between sections of segments.
These two issues make it less than ideal.

Other negatives: besides a lot of  Alexa issues.  This device has a  very limited touch interface.  The touchscreen can be helpful, but it almost always needs to be a mix between the touchscreen and talking to Alexa to get something done.  It would be soooooo much better if a few basic amazon apps were able to be used on the device.  An example.  Let's say you are listening to anything, and you want to change your selection, it almost always makes you use a voice command.  Though if you use a voice command to show you options it than you can select through the touchscreen.  Very intermixed and not intuitive.

The other Huge negative is that there is a very limited option to show most of the time.  SO if you were thinking that you would be able to have just a clock and pictures rotating... expect limited options and awkward unhelpful recommended content constantly.

The pro's,  sound is clear and the device does show the lyrics and song that is playing.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Each time I called Amazon Customer Service (888-230-4331), not only was I given the name of the person to whom I was speaking, but the person either stayed on the phone with me until my issue was perfectly solved or connected me with a representative who stayed on the phone with me until every issue was solved perfectly.  I TOTALLY recommend Echo Show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased a couple of Echo Show devices primarily for communication.  My wife and I work together from home, but her office is some distance from mine and I thought the Echo Show would be a good way to communicate because we could see each other and that adds a lot to communication. It certainly does the communication part great, but it is also great for making telephone calls (with Echo Connect) as I can ask it to call anyone on my contact list (there are hundreds) and it will dial the call and I can talk hands-free (great for someone with two or three computer screens operating).  I hadn't thought much about the security part and was surprised at how much I use it for that purpose.  We have a major renovation project underway to gut the main floor of our house while we live in the lower floor.  I can ask Echo to show me any room in the house and the front yard (where I have cameras located) and it will do that with audio. It has already saved me thousands of dollars when I discovered a subcontractor was lying to my contractor.  So yes, I am very happy with the GREAT DEVICE.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've purchased Kindles since they were invented and just got my first original Echo in July 2017. Alexa has been so helpful...she wakes me up in the morning, gives me news briefs, tells me the traffic, weather, gives me reminders, does math, tells me jokes, turns my lights on/off and she'll be getting more assignments as time goes on and I convert my home to a smart home. So I was excited to see the Echo Show on sale and didn't hesitate to purchase. Set-up was easy peasy and the Show was up and running in a minute. Alexa has become a part of my daily life. She gets smarter all the time and is starting to earn her keep. Soon, she'll be controlling all the lighting in my house, my thermostat and my TV. I didn't know I needed her until I had her; now I don't know how I'd live without her. One suggestion I'd make to Amazon, though, is rather than giving the option of changing her name to either Amazon, Echo or Computer, how about letting ME pick a name...any name for her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_478?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=478&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fortson","Nice hardware with some caveats","August 23, 2018","The Echo Show is a nice looking, well built piece of hardware.  The screen is very nice and sound is crisp and clear.  Great for music and some basic functions.  I never got into more detailed functions like viewing my front door via the Ring doorbell, or controlling home automation devices.

My complaint was with the Alexa software.  It didn't seem as intuitive as the Google assistant used in Google Home devices.  No follow-up commands so you always had to use the ""Alexa"" keyword.  And obvious (to me) commands seemed to have no effect.  ""Play classic jazz"" would lead to classical music.  ""Cancel music"" seemed to have no effect.  ""Home"" would show the home screen, yet the (wrong) music would continue playing.  All of these things are issues to me because I was used to the Google assistant.  If you're in a pure-Alexa house, they may not matter to you.

Other issues included no access to Youtube or Google search results.  Bing just doesn't match up in my experience.  And Youtube is where most of my recipes come from.

All in all, for me, this didn't fill my needs, but I recognize that it's partly because I've been trained by a couple of Google devices already.  If you're starting from scratch, or you already use Alexa, then this will probably work well for you.

In the end, I returned it and bought the the Lenovo Smart Display, an 8"" Google home device with video screen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the first Amazon Echo, the Tap, and the Dot. As a long time prime member I've been apart of the Amazon since it was ordering books on line. Lol many years. I preordered the Amazon Show, and received on the 28, June. WOW!! Amazing. If you love the Amazon Echo products, your going to be in heaven with this one. The screen is as good as my 4k, the sound is amazing for the size. I was really surprised on that. The Ads, and videos you have seen on this product don't come close I think, to what it can do. I can do all by voice. Can see my timers, Lists, Calendar, Music, Movies in prime or own in Amazon. YouTube videos as well. Look up recipes and it stays up on screen while making. I've had it Amazon Show two days, I don't want to be without it. I think they hit this one out of the park. It will Bluetooth to headphones, or bigger Bluetooth speakers if you want. But it sounds great. There's good Dolby speakers in this, it has good depth to them. I have mine in Kithen/Livingroom. If you use any of your echoes often, your going to a whole new level I think with this. This Amazon Show is touch screen as well as all voice. I would of give this more stars if I could. If your on the fence don't be. I've done calling and texting with this. It works great and so easy if your busy in the kitchen to answer calls by voice. Who calls you has to have the Amazon Show, or Alexa app on smart device. You can voice text app, Echo or the Show.
  I don't write a lot of reviews unless I really love the product. And I've paid for all my products, and get nothing for writing this review.
One more thing. Need Wifi for this product, but this was the easiest to set up of any of the Amazon products I think.

I bought the “Ring” doorbells that are supppsed to be supported by Alexa, and sadly the connection is minimal at best. I’m not sure if it’s a WiFi issue, an Alexa Show issue or a Ring doorbell issue.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the device and have it on my computer desk.  It generally works very well.  The E-Show is linked into my ""Living Room"" group along with my 1st generation Echo.  Of course, I had to resolve the naming issue since both devices could hear me from my desk.  The older, taller, and slimmer Echo has always been ""Alexa"" to me, and she retains her name to this day.  The newer, fatter, and shorter device (Echo Show) has been renamed ""Echo"".  One of the cool things I can do is to have both devices play the same music in unison.  For instance, I can say ""Alexa (or Echo), play my songs by Jimmy Buffett on the Living Room group"".  Within seconds, I'm a Son of a Son of a Sailor doing a little Havana Daydreamin' - and in stereo no less.

A couple of days ago I had a writing project to complete on my computer.  Trying to gather my thoughts, I stared at Echo.  What I noticed was her little, unfeeling, Cyclops eye(camera) staring back at me.  That was a bit disconcerting.  I tried to shake it off and continue my work.  A few minutes later the thought occurred to me, ""Mike, you are a handsome, strapping man.  What if there is band of hot women (with internet access to see through the Echo Cyclops), in the Amazon, and they are plotting to kidnap you?""  OK, that doesn't sound so bad, shake it off Mike.  Then, another thought occurred, ""Could these same hot women capture video of me entering banking information on my keyboard and steal my amassed millions of dollars?""  (Evidence of mental illness on my part?  You decide. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.)  Seriously, Cyclops was creeping me out.  I tore off the top quarter of an opened envelope and draped it over Cyclops.  There, I fixed that little problem, I thought.  Well, Miss Echo thought otherwise.  She was highly offended that I had covered her all-seeing Cyclops.  She dimmed herself down until I could barely see her screen.  I replied, Too bad Echo, this is our new arrangement until I figure out a better plan.

Well, fast-forward to early Sunday morning.  I'm sitting at my desk enjoying a fresh cup of coffee in the morning quiet; no TV, no computer, no radio, just me and my coffee.  And then I heard the sound.  It was a subtle tick.  Or, perhaps it was tock.  I couldn't be certain.  What I knew for sure was that the sound was coming from Miss Echo every 45 - 120 seconds.  Apparently she was having issues with our new arrangement.  Flummoxed, I contacted the Amazon help desk.  I explained the sound issue to John, who promised it would be no more than two minutes until he return with an answer.  Two minutes turned into five minutes.  Six minutes.  Seven minutes.  And then I heard the click on the phone.  Like magic in the wind, the call had been dropped from the Amazon end.  No problem I thought, Amazon will call me right back.  Nope. They never did.  Well, the tick-tock routine continued.  Tick...60 secs...Tock...45 secs...Tick...120 secs and so on.  After about 10 minutes, I noticed that the tick-tock routine had stopped.  Hmm,  how did that happen.  I don't know.  I drank more coffee and settled on a new plan of action.

The new plan is simple.  Alexa and Miss Echo are going to swap positions in the living room.  Alexa will get to come home to my desktop where she has always deserved to be.  Miss Echo will assume her new position on the far side of the living room where she will not be able to ""eyeball"" me at every turn and keep her all-seeing Cyclops out of my business.  She will have to content herself with continual facial recognition of my three children in the picture on the wall or she can study my bookshelf and algorithmize  which books I might be interested in buying on Amazon.

Seriously, I do like the Echo Show.  It is a very capable piece of equipment that continues to improve from week to week.  I see very big things ahead for the Echo Show.  I just don't like it eyeballing my every move.  I would like to see Amazon implement a physical shade that allows the customer effectively stop the camera from functioning as designed when desired by the customer.  The truth is that we don't know who is on the other end or tapping into the Echo Show internet stream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_72?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=72&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When watching the introductory video it seemed to work well as a replacement for Facetime, Skype or other video conferencing applications. We have two offices, one in Northern California and one in Southern California.  I bought two hoping to join our offices without having to tie up someone's computer or cell phone.  Technically, it would work...but, the units need to be set up with an individual Amazon account.  I tried making an Amazon account for the office but the unit requires a cell phone to makes calls.  Our offices still have land lines.  You can set up different ""family members"" but everyone would need their own Amazon account and you would need to shuffle between accounts.  The bottom line is that none of us want to put our personal information on a work device.  I'm disappointed that it did not work for us in a small business setting.

(Though I've purchased 8 devices in all so I do love these things!)
I find it isn't as responsive to commands as my other echo devices, I quite often have to repeat myself- so often that I ended up changing its name and moved a dot into the same room and use it for most commands, i.e. Alexa turn on the lamp, Alexa arm ADT etc. The dot has no problem understanding! This has a decent speaker so I primarily use it  for music which leads to the next annoyance- it doesn't come with its own remote! Because I use it for music, if the volume is up and I'm across the room it can't hear me when I say pause or volume down etc. I did program another Echo remote to work with it but not sure what one would do if they didn't have another device.  And not the fault of the show, but I knew it was compatible with Skybell, so I (wrongly!) thought I'd be able to view my front door via the Show or at least view the video I'd asked it to record (set up via IFTTT) from the Skybell. I can't. To view the video I still have to login to my Skybell app. This is already doable via The Ring. Hopefully Skybell will catch up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The good:
The hardware is awesome. The speakers in it sound great, and the touch screen produces sharp images and the response time feels fast and accurate. The video calling function also produces nice and clear video calls.

The not-so-good:

The user interface is a little wonky.  If I'm listening to something on the device and get a phone call or some other sort of interruption, the device doesn't properly resume what I was listening to. If my news flash briefing is interrupted, then it won't resume playing, and when I ask it to resume my flash briefing it starts over from the beginning. Also, navigating through the device doesn't appear to be fully baked yet. Sure, I can ask the device to pull up certain videos on YouTube, but it would be much easier if there were a YouTube app that I could scroll through so I could choose from videos of which I don't know the precise name of. There's a beautiful touchscreen on the thing and Amazon has provided few ways of actually using it. Ideally there would be apps available on a home screen, and not hidden somewhere behind a series of voice commands. It would be so nice if the thing had a ton of apps so I could easily pick something from Netflix or Hulu, or a recipe app.

The on screen suggestions are also a little annoying. I don't need a collection of banners that read ""Ask Alexa to play John Mayer songs"", or ""Ask Alexa to tell me more about Rob Kardashian's Twitter Meltdown"". I would like to have the option of a photo slideshow when the thing is not in use. Right now it just cycles through these annoying banners.

I have faith in Amazon though. I hope/predict that a ton of apps are coming down the pike, and that they will be available on some type of GUI.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Many questions that are asked of Alexa are ""not known"" or misunderstood.  I understand the reasoning why, but it does get monotonous having to say Alexa before every question or task asked to perform.  Especially if asking several things in a row.  Was thinking it would be more like an extension of a PC that would supply answers or suggestions to any questions asked.  Great for music or making lists of items needed, tasks to perform, setting of alarms and timers, or placing orders on Amazon for items needed.  I have not connected it with the phone service to try that application.  Also great for playing mind/learning games, movies, cartoons, or television shows if you have a Prime account with Amazon.  Keeps the grandkids entertained. The picture is great and the sound is too.  Don't get me wrong, it does a great deal, just not all that I was expecting it to do at this time.  I asked Alexa if she was intelligent and the reply was that she does the best that she can do and is always learning.

I love all of them except the show.  I can't say it's complete crap, but overall it's pretty pointless so far.  I have no need for video chatting, and the biggest use I could see is for the kitchen to show my recipes.  Problem with this plan: The show only displays for around 30 seconds and then goes back to the home screen.

Pros:
1. Nice to see lyrics on screen when playing music
2. Video calling - seems to work well, I just have no need for the feature.
3. At least it isn't that dumb thing to help you buy clothes

Cons:
1. Speaker sucks
2. Microphone is one-directional.  I replaced the echo in my kitchen with the show, but if i'm in the living room (literally on the other side of my show, the echo doesn't always hear me.

I am raising my rating to three stars. Why not five stars? In my opinion, it’s just not that much better than a plain Echo. Sure, it has a screen, but aside from looking at my Cloud Cam feeds every once in a while, the screen is of no use to me. But the lack of value add for the screen isn’t the reason I do not give it five stars.

I take away one star for the low quality audio. It’s not as bad as an Echo Dot, but not as good as a full size Echo. With the size and shape of this Show’s cabinet, they could have done much better with the acoustics. Call me when you come out with a Bose or Klipsch version. They could work wonders with this much cabinet volume.

I took away the second star because they insist on using approximately the bottom 25% of the vertical screen real estate to show irritating “Things to try with Alexa” hints. You cannot turn these things off. They are there regardless of what skill you are using. The only way to hide them is to set the device to Do Not Disturb mode. Here’s a tip I’d love to see pop up one day... “Alexa, turn off things to try.”

==== Original review from 04/13/2018 ====
I own six Echo devices, one full size Echo, one Echo Show and four Echo dots. The primary thing I use them for is to listen to music, either from my Amazon library or from an internet radio app like TuneIn or IHeartRadio. I bought this Show to use in my home office because I wanted the additional ability to view the Amazon CloudCam video from my front porch so I could be alerted and get my frequent amazon deliveries before someone swiped them.

At first I was pleased with the Show, despite the fact that the audio wasn’t as good as what I previously had using a Dot and an old set of computer speakers. However, at some point it began making an irritating popping sound. It sounds like a vinyl LP with a big scratch is being played. The only difference is it doesn’t happen at regular intervals. It occurs between tracks when I play them from my library as well as randomly while playing internet radios stations. I still use the full size Echo and the Dots in other areas of my home and none of them have this problem.

I work 10 hours or more from home every day and listen to music the whole time. For the internet radio, I can make the popping stop for a little while by telling Alexa to stop playing music, giving it a few minutes and starting again, but after a few minutes it is back. I find myself shouting at Alexa to just STOP!!!!!

For this reason, I cannot recommend the Show. I am not the only one to experience this. Search in the questions and reviews, you’ll find others. Until Amazon resolves this, I would recommend you avoid the Show.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_428?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=428&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mostly use it with TP Links to turn on lights and appliances. I will add security devices as I can afford them but for now I can use the smartphone app and Echo Show as a camera focused at the front door of my home when I’m away. I get weather reports, keep shopping lists, reminders and timers for everything. Not having to punch in a timer when I’m busy in the kitchen is a plus. Alexa also helps with recipes. The Show has a great speaker so I’ve given up my Bose Bluetooth. Alexa will play anything from my Amazon MP3 purchases but I also have the option of an affordable monthly Amazon music subscription....but I have so many Amazon purchases, I haven’t needed that yet. If you’re contemplating an Echo purchase, definitely spring for the Show. The monitor gives me so many additional suggestions throughout the day...functional, newsworthy and fun.....that you won’t get with the canister Echo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_451?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=451&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bathroom. Basement.  Living room etc ect.

I ended up getting this echo because i had a $100 off coupon. I figured why not.

Even if you take the screen away the echo is so much better.  For instance if i tell it to turn the ac up on my nest. It says Ok and its done.

My google will lower my tv and tell me what it is doing. Very annoying.

I will be replacing most of those google homes with the echo show.

My only drawbacks and hence not a 5 star:
I wish they would link and play music together.  Like a whole house audio system. My google did that.

I wish they would turn on  my Smart Tv.

I love that this works with my Sleepnumber bed and it also shows me my nest doorbell amd other cameras.

I also use it in the kitchen for recipes when cooking.

They do need to get YouTube on there.

Basically amazon created one amazing assistant.  Definitely good buy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

K.","Just part of the total Smart Home Echo package.","February 25, 2018","At the suggestion of a friend, I decided to try the Alexa Echo lifestyle.  At first, I could not imagine what I would use it for.  Why the heck would I need to ask Alexa to do anything for me???  Well, I bought the Echo Show along with an Echo and and Echo Dot.  I was immediately hooked!  I began with smart plugs, then some smart bulbs.  Then I bought an Echo Plus, the one with the hub.  After figuring it all out, I ended up returning the Echo Plus and I bought 3 more Echo Dots.  With two of the Dots, I bought MOKCAO POWER+ Cordless Speaker with Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0749K9C1T/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)'  I found that this speaker with a Dot gave me as good or better sound than having a full Echo or an Echo Plus.  The bonus is that each of them is portable so I can take it anywhere and treat it as a bluetooth speaker.  The 3rd Dot is now hard wired to my 7.1 Suround system in my gameroom and the 4th wired to my Bose Wave Radio in my garage.  So, as you can guess, I'm all in with Alexa.  The Dots are great if you can hook the up with a speaker as i have done with two or a stereo system as I have with the other two.  The Echo Show is the one we have in our morning room, the room we spend 90% of our time.  The reason is that it has very good sound quality all by itself and the screen is great for seeing lirics of songs.  But it best for linking your photos up to Amazon Photos and playing all of your photos like a digital picture frame.
I plan to use this same review for all of the Echo products I am now enjoying, Echo Show, Echo, and 4 Echo Dots.  Even my wife is asking Alexa to play her music and that is a complete positive testament.  Oh, did I mention that I set up an ""everywhere"" music group so I can now have music playing throughout the house.

At the time of purchase YT had been re-added to the Show's capability, but was quickly removed again, I was able to use it the first day, but not any other day after that.  I ended up keeping it as an expensive (even though I got a good deal on it) alarm/clock replacement.

I use this product infrequently for anything other than a convenient way to set timers or reminders, which it is bad at since it won't let you set a reminder for anything over 24 hours away, so it is basically useless other than for short reminders like for cooking or laundry.  Alarms are limited since you also can't set alarms over 24 hours away except for repeating alarms which you can't set to skip so on holidays you have to remember to cancel the alarm then, after the holiday has passed, re-set your alarm.

This device sits on my dresser across my room from my bed where I can see the clock and the outside temperature, one of its only useful features.  It would constantly scroll through suggested actions, like news articles, jokes, or other random things it can do for you.  Which was fine except you cannot customize this content at all so it constantly suggests the birthday roundup, which is something I have less than 0 interest in (meaning not only do I not want to hear it, if for some reason it did play it would actively make me annoyed), but of course I can't customize the content on my own device because that would be too useful.  It had a large portion of the screen dedicated to the clock/temp in the upper left with an alarm indicator in the top right with headlines and other suggestions in the lower left.  Well, so much for any usable features on this device.  They pushed out a UI update recently which shrunk the clock/temp text to an unreadably small text in the top left (this might be readable on a bed stand a foot from your head, but not from across a room), and pushed the advertisements (let's call them what they are) into taking up about 80% of the screen right in the middle.  Bear in mind there is little to no customization of this device, minus the ability to set a wallpaper... oh right, they also, as the ads scroll, now put up different images for the advertisements in the background which scroll by and are incredibly distracting on a display screen.  There is no way to revert or disable any of this functionality.  It's like buying a kindle with advertisements for the full kindle price without any of the features, YAY!  Or maybe more appropriate, buying a Kindle and, after owning it for awhile, them turning it into one with advertisements.

Other than that it is a basic Alexa.  Moderately useful with all the downsides of an active listening AI, it hears its name randomly for no reason, it doesn't listen to you when there is any background noise, and it is tied into your Amazon account so it can buy things you don't want or subscribe you to services you didn't ask for.  This is not an exaggeration.  I asked it to play a song that is free for Prime users, it heard some completely unrelated song that was only part of Amazon Music and said it could sign me up for that, I said ""no way"", it said Ok I've signed you up.  I then had to log onto my Amazon account and cancel the membership.  So good times there.

Basically, if you want Alexa get a normal Echo device, the show is basically useless and they've only made it worse as time has gone on.  I guess if you watch a lot of Prime stuff and don't mind watching it on a 4"" screen because you're in the kitchen or the bathroom or something maybe it could be useful...","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_36?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=36&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Or, when I have moved, I will ask Alexa 1 something but echoshow will mention it did not hear me or did not understand.

But after a week she learned how to use it, and here we are almost 3 years later and we have 10 Alexa's in our house and she can't live without it.

Here are some common ways I use Echo Show:
Alexa, show me the driveway/front-door camera (I live on a popular street)
Alexa, play <word> on YouTube
Alexa, play <movie title>

Here are some common ways I use Echo (any of my Echo's):
Alexa, turn on/off the bedroom/hallway lights
Alexa, turn on/off the projector
Alexa, play popular music (while I'm in the shower, my phone/tablet aren't loud enough for me to hear over water)

My goal this year is to use Alexa to control my Media Center (Alexa play this movie, resume this show, etc). It's possible with Plex, but I use Kodi and it's a very complex setup :/

Since Echo was the first it's in class, and has the most apps, I'm looking forward to seeing what developers come up with in the coming days/weeks with the Echo Show!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When you ask it to play video, it asks if I want to create a station on Pandora, performs a web search for garbage that I wouldn't search for, etc.  For example, when asked to play ""daniel tiger's neighborhood"" for a child, it first asked if I wanted to add a station for Dan Fogelberg to my Pandora.  A second attempt saw it returned bing search results for kylie jenner.  A third attempt started to play Jack Reacher.  Over a dozen additional attempts returned similar results. None of them actually pulled up Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood from Amazon Video (This was supposedly one of the main selling points).

I have also watched a few movies on Amazon Prime video and listen to music on it. The set up was extremely easy as well. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that it has to remain plugged in and it doesn't follow us like I see the Facebook portal does. I'm sure those things will come eventually. But I am very happy to have it now!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_183?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=183&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Worst thing was power came unplugged and disconnected video call while showing her our kitchen remodel, (it was easy to call back).  Mom had not answered her phone or email for 3 days. Turns our her laptop had crashed and her hearing had deteriorated and she couldn't hear her cell phone ring, (she forgets to check for missed calls). Yesterday was the first time I had ever placed a call with any Echo device.  I simple said call Mom and to my surprise she answered. Huge relief. I think it helps that Echo Show is stationary and that we placed it next to where she spends a lot of time. Obviously Mom struggles with her hearing. A few months ago when it became clear she was sleeping through her alarm I set her up with an Echo to help wake her in the morning, (in the free app you download to your phone you can control the volume level (Loudest for Mom) of the wake up alarm).  Total life saver. Immediately she stopped missing her morning book club not to mention her doctor appointments. Feeling good about myself over the holidays I figured why not get her a Echo Show.  On a roll during the set-up I got her signed up with Audible so she could listen to Trevor Noah's Born a Crime and I guess I enabled something about phone calls off her contacts list.  Then I flew home and, like I said,  soon she mysteriously dropped out of touch. Getting worried I asked Alexa to ""call Mom"". I had never used an Echo to make a ""phone"" call. Evidently when it rang it was completely natural for her to tap the green answer button and accept the call.  Nice for both of us to be able to see each other as the visual communicates so much about a person so quickly.  Mom looked great!

What else is cool is about Echo Show? Its nice to see the time and temperature at a glance and it's fun to see lyrics to songs it turns out you never knew in the first place.  Other cool Echo features...  NPR Flash News, easy answers to cooking questions, lists and how to spell hard words. Ordering new stuff and of course Amazon music and the fun of calling up favorite songs from memory.  Can't wait to see what new features they come up with for Mom.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can simply say Alexa “show me living room” and then it pulls up camera in living room. I also love the fact that all of my smart plugs are also compatible with Alexa. I love being able to say turn on lamp while laying in bed. I also recently found a cool feature where you can set a routine, like say Alexa start my day, Alexa tells me the weather and turns on my lamp. It can be customized to whatever you like. I can use the show as my alarm too. You can also put a personal photo on the screen of your choosing. So many features and I’m sure many more I have not figured out just yet.

I’ve had an Alexa for years, since they first came out.
Amazon Echo might be an enhanced Alexa with visuals and better speakers. Unfortunately, Echo is not a smarter Alexa. Eventually, they both use the same app on your phone.
I downloaded an app to count the time I spend brushing my teeth. The command is “Alexa, ask Toothbrush brushing to begin brushing.” Needless to say, after writing this, such command will be the only onevI know. So, I’ve never had a dialogue with this machine or from her sister. It’s been more of a conversation between an inept master and a confused slave. Until the master gives up, which makes Echo nothing more than a glorified desktop clock.
Most of the apps, or skills, are for meditation. I’ve enabled various meditation skills, but my confused slave tends to deliver Amazon music instead.
Listening to the news can take an hour, depending on the number of skills enabled. Often happens that news are a week old. There are lots of -in my view- junk skills and very few that could be helpful.
I was looking forward to making calls. Contact download is an all or nothing. Since I can’t download all my contacts (for Hipaa reasons) this is not a feature I could use. Both, Alexa and Echo can dial numbers dictated to them.
So far, I’ve been unable to make ring doorbell work with Echo. I haven’t tried this with Alexa. Nevertheless, I have been able to watch prime videos, listen to Amazon music and use other Amazon features with no problems.
I would like Alexa and hr sister to be more intuitive. I’ve been waiting for years for this to happen. I doubt she’ll ever change. She was not designed to be an artificial assistant in every way possible. She was designed to deliver Amazon products; and Echo does this much better than Alexa.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have an Amazon Echo in the bedroom and the Show in the kitchen. I find it is everything it is advertised to be, and more. The setup is so easy I have watched 2 tech-noobs successfully do it in minutes. (These people constantly ask me things like ""how do I find settings on my phone?"").

The customer service is just amazing. You call the help number given in the app and in a couple of minutes, you have a live person on the phone who goes the extra mile to get the right answer. I called a few times to get answers on some how-to things, like ""can Alexa handle double-authentication on wifi - answer is yes). The rep double-checked with one of their wifi experts before giving me the answer. I also had a problem with the message notification bubble not appearing on my screen. Turns out I had to remove the middle initial from my registration name. I was surprised she figured that out so quickly.

The screen is sharp and clear and I can easily read everything without my reading glasses. The prime music/video and youtube integrations are excellent and be sure to take a look at using the tunein application which offers some interesting podcasts and news. I like how, when I set a timer, it keeps going off until I dismiss it. I do wish you could personalize how many times Alexa gives you a reminder in case you are out of the room. Right now she tells you twice but the reminder is also displayed on the screen for a while.

I am finding new cool things that Alexa can do everyday and I have no doubt that future updates will add more. If you are looking for a device that is compatible with Chromecast, this isn't for you. But if you are looking for a personal assistant that can make your life easier and add a bit humor (through easter eggs), I highly recommend it.

UPDATE:
Now that Youtube no longer works with the Show, it has lost a good part of it's functionality that made it worth the cost. Moreover, those of us who bought it after reading the advertised statement that Youtube was included, feel rather ripped off. It's like buying a car with cool hubcaps and driving it a while, then the dealer takes the hubcaps back. You paid for them, but you don't get them. It still has a lot of pros, but I am lowering my rating for this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Problems I ran into the device which caused me to open a ticket with Amazon are as follows:
1. Prime Video will only display the first 40 items in my watch list (I have over 100), though every other device displays correctly.
2. Calendar is constantly a day behind. Right now I am looking at items from yesterday when I have at least 2 appointments for today. When asked Echo will verbally give me the correct information.
Amazon tech support is disorganized and its left hand does not know what its right hand is doing. I spent one hour being shuttled from department to department before anyone would stop long enough to actually listen to the problem. When I finally got someone from support on the phone the person was obviously not familiar with the product and I ended up doing more of the troubleshooting then she did. Note - the ticket was opened on 11/28 as of today 12/21 I have no resolution and Amazon support has not contacted me with any updates with the exception of the nasty-gram that I sent them on 12/7 demanding an update.

Bottom line, I bought this so my GF could be able to watch Prime Video without having to drag out her laptop but if I can't access my Watch List properly that defeats the purpose of the device. Can't access Netflix through the device so that makes it doubly useless. Will probably keep the device for the sole purpose of listening to music - the speakers are rather nice.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_295?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=295&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It then started shutting down and rebooting on its own fairly frequently. We sent it in for repair and received a ""repaired"" unit that turned on once, shutdown on its own a short time later, and never worked again (in a different house from where we experienced the problems initially). After following up with Amazon again, the best they could do by this point was to allow us to return the unit and to incur a significant restocking fee. We own several Echo and other Amazon products and have enjoyed them. However, we're very disappointed in our experience with this product and the support team in this case.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_214?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=214&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just wish that  the Amazon Show was able to connect with Youtube as it did when it first came out. Since it came out it was discontinued due to some ongoing feud between Google and Amazon which I think is stupid as it would benefit both parties for this to be straightened out.

 I have just read that amazon will be selling chromecast on their site and I hope that this opens up a way for Youtube to be shared on the amazon show as it was advertised. I am a Prime member and I think I am being shortchanged because of this. If you can view Youtube over the internet, I think it should be the same on the Amazon show.  The only one that benefits from this stupidity is Roku as you can view both, Youtube and Amazon prime movies on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This device has proven so easy that my grandparents have been able to use it regularly and we NEVER have issues hearing or seeing them. The Echo Show has allowed my grandparents to see their great grandchildren, which is such a blessing as we live in different states. Because of their age, it's so important to me that my kids get to see them and recognize them, this has really been a gift.

We basically bought this as a glorified video chat device, but turns out my Grandmother loves talking to Alexa! She told me she has been saying goodnight to Alexa, and ""Alexa is so polite, she tells me to have a good night!"" - this is so funny to me and I love it.

Amazon support is worthless.  Wasted money.","July 20, 2018","I bought 2 of these to use as an intercom.  It works ok for that.  But, the screens of both units are going bad.  They have jagged horizontal lines tearing across the screen.  If I power down and restart, the lines go away for a few hours, but come back.  Buyers be forewarned, Amazon support will ask for the serial number of the unit.  But, the serial number isn't printed anywhere on the unit.  The Amazon support people expect you to keep the original box for the life of the unit.  If I had to keep all the amazon boxes for everything I buy, I'd have to rent a small warehouse.  This experience is causing me to think I'll buy less from amazon and more from other vendors.  Amazon's support chat was a complete waste of time and cause of frustration.  The woman on phone call support was pleasant and tried to be helpful, but she kept saying the device wasn't registered to my Amazon account and she couldn't help me.

The Echo show is no different! I held off on purchasing it when it came out because I just didn't want to pay that much for it. The priced dropped just before the new model was released (I didn't catch that!) and I snagged one for the kitchen area. Although it isn't the newest model, we haven't been disappointed.

The screen is large and bright, and looks great. We use it to catch news, podcasts, view recipes and listen to music while in the kitchen each day. It also controls seven Alexa-capable WiFi plugs we have throughout the house which is great when you need to turn the lights on/off and you're in the middle of something.

I have to admit we've become  an Amazon/Echo household. In spite of the fears of having audio/video devices always on and listening for commands, I'm not too worried about SkyNet taking over. We started out with a couple of Amazon Firesticks for our TVs, then got a couple of Fire HD tablets one Christmas, then bought the larger Echo device we still use in the basement family room, along with an Echo Spot in my home office, and Echo dots in each room. When the new Alexa came out we got one and use it in the den for music and controlling plugs and it sounds grate. I've even registered to the Echo car version when it comes out! It's made it a lot easier being able to remotely control lights, fans and some extension cords as well.

Bezos and team, keep up the good work, but don't let Alexia become self-aware.

Originally it was not clear how to adjust settings on the screen, that was my main issue, with the latest update from Amazon it provided the details I was missing on how to manage the screen.  I kept looking for these as well as the initial command to sleep did not appear to work, it does now.

Have now used this to replace my alarm clock and move my original echo out of the bedroom into the living room.

5 stars will come when I can change the visual settings on the clock as well as select more random pictures than what is uploaded.

Much happier than when it first arrived, if you want an echo with display it is worth it for the additional price.

When the ECHO first came out I jumped on it and am glad I did.  Mostly I use it for music, news, alarms, weather, and the occasional fact related question (most the time Alexa doesn't have an answer).

I did the same for TAP and TAP follows me around the house when I am working outside, again mostly music but having Alexa nearby is helpful.

Show, I think could be very good but some things I still haven't figured out:

1.  No easy way to figure out the timeout on the display.
2.  Limited home screen choices, great I can add pictures but it would be even better if I could configure a few things to display what is important to me.
3.  Backlight - want to use it to replace my alarm clock but the backlight has a lot of bleed and can't dim it (at least have not found a way to control the backlight)

Haven't tried calling and looking forward to that when a few in the family get one.  The fact is, it will likely be very good but needs some better management capabilities in the Alexa app and through voice commands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_168?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=168&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought this to use with some Wyze cameras I put up around my house (main concerns my child's nursery and the front door) I loved that I could ask Alexa to show me those cameras and it would pop up on the screen.... However it takes so long for it to load. I could live with the nursery taking a minute to load but when it's the front door I need it to be quick when someone is knocking or else what's the point?  I am not sure if that's more on the side of the cameras...the Echo or both but if they could get together and figure that out it would be fantastic! Thanks!!!! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(If she could).","July 26, 2017","I know that many media folks have stated that the ""Drop-in"" feature of the Echos is ""creepy"" and can see their point.  Here's a different perspective.  Mom is now almost 95 and she has short term memory dementia, she's in great spirits but I really can't teach her anything technical, like dialing a phone or even pressing a memory dial button.  She lives near my sister and is 2 hours away so visiting is always a bit of a project.

I thought I'd try setting a Show next to her rocking chair.  I can now ""Drop-in"" on her every day and share some face time with her, visit with her grand daughter, see the dog whom she LOVES, and just make her smile.  The beauty is that there is no interaction needed on her end, the Caregivers and my Mom love this setup.  The fact that I can use my phone from anywhere and actually see and talk to Mom, and show her things  is hugely entertaining and comforting for Mom, and everyone in the family.

So I say with extreme gratitude, Thank You Amazon for creating an amazingly personally helpful tool for the elderly.

Personally I am enjoying all of the other great features of an Alexa with a screen, using her with my Arlo Cameras, etc. It truly is quite an amazing platform!  In my office I added a small Pioneer bookshelf stereo, I can be listening to Spotify, Pandora etc and say ""Alexa, connect Bluetooth"", the Pioneer stereo is Bluetooth enabled, it can be OFF and with that single voice command, the Show will wake up the Pioneer, and begin playing the sound over its speakers with no other intervention from me!  This is magical stuff!

The only bug I have at the moment, ""Alexa, turn off the screen"", the screen turns off, then immediately turns back on.  Tell her again and the screen stays off, pretty consistent bug.  Edit- Seems fixed now!

1/06/2018 Still enjoying my Echo Shows very much, I don't expect this to replace a tablet, it does many things very well, besides being indispensable with visiting Mom.  Currently there is one in the Kitchen and it is used by the family to play lots of music, having the screen is really nice to be able to see what's playing etc.  We are trying Amazon Music and so far it's pretty sweet as well, ""Alexa show me all albums from Keith Urban"", up comes pictures of all of his 12 or so album covers, touch one and play the album.  Alexa, ""Connect Bluetooth"" and the Show connects to a Bluetooth receiver I have on our whole house stereo.  Alexa ""Turn on the Stereo"", Alexa controls the Logitech Harmony remote to power up the stereo and now we are hearing music everywhere, nice.

We've also added some Ring cameras and doorbell, ""Alexa, show me the front door"", now I'm looking out front.

Oh, and our doggie monitor/treat shooter, Furbo, ""Alexa, ask Furbo to toss a treat"" is our dog ""Cookie"" 's favorite skill!

Bottom line, this is a very powerful system, don't get me wrong we love our Apple products (Phones, iPads, and Macs)  but I prefer this Amazon ecosystem for my home music, automation, and general questions etc. as it's a fairly open system that plays well with 3rd parties when compared to the likes of Apple.

I would never have imagined all that is possible with these units!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

We use them all the time and loved them so I was really excited to get the Show. I primarily purchased it for my Dad who has Parkinson's and it has been working out great! He can ask Alexa to show him videos on YouTube, play books from Audible and get the weather, news etc. all without having to use his hands. He has been really frustrated trying to use remote controls, keyboards, tablets and the like with shaky hands and this has solved a lot of problems. He does have a shaky voice and Alexa is able to understand him. I really think this is a revolutionary product for people like my parents (my mom has Alzhiemer's.) They can easily read what is on the screen (it gives tips) and say those things. My Dad and I played Jeopardy on it last night and it was hilarious. I am very much looking forward to seeing how this device can enrich the life of our senior population. I showed it to my Dad's speech therapist and she thought it was genius and is already sharing it with her patients who have movement disorders.

I am hoping to get a similar device for my brother so my Dad can call him and have video chats whenever he wants. I do wish Alexa would just let you call anyone and not just people with the Echo app but it's not that big of a deal for us personally. Also, if it would work with Fire tv that would be awesome too since my parents are not so good withe remotes and buttons. Overall, though, it's really great and we are enjoying it. I put pictures of my kids and niece on there for my Dad to look at as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The video delay from the web camera ...","August 15, 2017","If using it for a live feed from a web camera to the Show - it isn't good enough. The video delay from the web camera (Logi Circle) to the Echo Snow was 10 seconds - way too long. When I used the app that came with the camera, the video delay was only 2 seconds. For this to be an effective live feed display unit, the delay needs to be greatly reduced to around 2 seconds if not shorter. On a positive side, the video quality was quite good.

Worked with Amazon support for about 90 minutes but the delay was never reduced. Both the camera and the Show were on the same wireless network.

The video screen is slightly nice for viewing lyrics, but beyond that i find it unnecessary.

The plus to the echo show is that the sound quality is decent and it offers an easy way to play music on demand.

But there are many dissapointments with amazon alexa products in general.  The voice recognition is mediocre.  The intelligence level of alexa (eg amazons searching algorithms and alexa programming) are mediocre to poor, and sometimes comically bad.  And the library of music available from the Prime subscription is very hit or miss.  They will have tons of songs by one artist, and then be missing various well known songs.  You have to pay extra for the full amazon music library.  WTF amazon?  Id rather just get spotify, which is better.

If i had to do it over again, id get the google equivalent for its superior voice recognition and overall value.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Reese","A cloud-based digital picture frame that happens to have Alexa built in. When it works.","June 20, 2018","UPDATE: I've already had to replace this under warranty once because of screen flickering problems, and I was too lazy to set up the photo album thing all over again, so now it doesn't even do that for me (but to be fair it would if I'd spend the time). Now the replacement is having more ambiguous issues where it occasionally turns off and won't come back on all day, even after being unplugged which makes me less than motivated to set up this one as I want since it'll probably have to go back too. If Amazon wants to upgrade me to a gen 2 echo show then this one will earn itself a couple of stars back just as a disposable placeholder device.

I'm overall satisfied with my purchase as I bought my show during a deep discount sale and got an additional 25% off with some coupons (Amazon move and another for my 1st Gen echo keeling over unexplainedly shortly out of warranty).
My favorite feature is that the Show acts as a digital picture frame and automatically adds photos I add to a prime photos album. Digital picture frames with similar functionality exist, but they're even more expensive than a Show and without Alexa built in.
I have my Show in the kitchen and use it regularly for timers and controlling the TV in the living room (open floor plan) and listening to audiobooks or music. The jeopardy skill is fabulous on the Show.

That said, I'm pretty disappointed that there aren't more skills by now designed specifically for the Show and I'm sad there's no option for Netflix or Hulu, on prime videos which can be lacking.

In summary: don't buy it at full price. Even now so long after launch, there's not much content to really utilize the screen. But if you have any desire for a 7"" digital picture frame, totally scoop one up during the next sale. I'm planning on getting them for all the grandparents when Christmas rolls around again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_419?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=419&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I want to use it but not be constantly socially and marketing accountable. I enjoy writing on paper, it's just a different way of thinking from my tech notes, I use both.

Which brings me to one of the most fantastic tech additions to my home and to my life. I changed the name from Alexa to ""Computer"" My Alexa was responding to commercials on my television. I use far less paper, music throughout my home, I have a DOT in my bedroom.

Jordan","Improved relations with my Mother!","October 16, 2017","My dad passed two years ago. I was getting married, and although I was a professional who could easily afford an apartment on my own, I had to leave my mother alone so I can have my own life, without having to worry about her. For over a year and a half, we’ve been talking on the phone literally daily, just to make sure she’s ok and not too lonely. The phone can only do so much though, and we’ve had our share of fights, especially over finances.

My mother is technologically illiterate, even for a 68 year old. A apple iPhone or iPad, wouldn’t work. An amazon fire tablet, too complicated to use, or have it be charged. About the only technological she knew was how to turn on the tv, change channels, etc. and also turn on or off her cell phone ( read: dumb phone )

My mother lives about two hours away driving. It was at a point where every 3rd or so weekend, I was guilted for not coming to see her. This was getting out of hand.

By getting the show and being able to see her face, and vice versa, it has definitely improved our relationship, as well as helping the relationship between her and my wife. She now has no problem not seeing us physically for more than every 6 weeks! She loves that she can just call with her voice. It’s simple and easy.

We set it up so that we can drop in on her ( she’s not the type to be naked ), but she can’t drop in on us, and it has worked extremely well.

This is great!

Obviously we got the two pack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had a few other Echo devises including the Echo Plus and Echo Dot.  I’ve been move over a lot of my house to smart technology including lights, outlets and the like.  I don’t have a TV in my room.  Just this Echo Show.  It’s nice to have the screen savers with music to sleep.  I like being able to watch a show sometimes Although the prime feature is lacking quite a bit and it’s often hard for my Echo Show to find what I want to watch.  Sometimes I feel I have to “trick” it into finding the correct season of a show by asking to “show me” episodes of the Americans and then I can skip to the correct season.  There’s no way to search for show or movies even though I have Amazon Prime.  And all this was still worth it till the screen started flickering and running lines through it.  I’m past the return date and there doesn’t seem much I can do.  I’ve only had it for 3 or 4 months.  The Echo Show 2nd gen was released the next day after I bought this.  I think that would of been a much safer choice.  Maybe I’ll try again in the future with another model.

I .got a set of these with the hope that I would be able to talk to and see my grandkids every day. This will not do that. The machine I have does not answer the simplest questions. It comes on at all hours of the night and starts talking, and scares me a lot! NOT FUNY. The settings change out of no where. The alarm never works. I have missed appointments. I would set the clock a couple times for times to go off during the day to test it out. Didnt go off. I set it for the morning appointments and after missing one I set two clocks, the other one was not from amazon. The echo I will ask for it to play a song and it doesnt even come close to playing what I ask for. I have a playlist that is ""MY list"" and it never gets it. So i go online and get my songs to play then when they are playing I ask for it to turn them either down or up and it will not answer me. I will scream out ECHO and nothing. So I have to do it manually. This is just not worth the effort and frustration. Now out of nowhere, the  time size has changed on the screen. That was the last reason I even left it out.... I do not sleep well at night at all, and need a clock that I can see at night. It did at least have the time correct and it was about an inch or so high so I could see it without my glasses. Now all of a sudden the time has shrunk to half the size and has dimmed so I can not even see it. My other mistake was not returning it when I could have. I kept thinking that it would get better and it was just a glitch and it would work itself out but nope. Instead it has gotten worse. This was not cheap and if I had not had the option to have six months to pay for it then I could not have gotten it.

It needs more time in the oven.  Expensive for what you get.","March 16, 2018","Of all my Echo's (I have 7 of them), this is the worst of the bunch.

It is buggy as hell.  It locks up a lot.  Stability when watching video's is terrible.  And if you ask it questions or something while watching a video, it ends up dumping you back to the front page more often then it returns you to the video.  Very annoying.  I thought it was going to be perfect for the kitchen, but I was wrong.  I would return it but I'm outside the return window.

UPDATE: I can't change the score for the product.  It is what it is.  But what I can do is say as always for me, Amazon Support came through and took care of me, and I didn't even ask them :)

FIVE STARS for Amazon support.

Now, if you are after a large screen device that supports Alexa hands free, get the Kindle Fire 10.1 W/Alexa Hands Free.  Not only do you get an Alexa Device with a HUGE screen that does everything the show does and more (like YouTube via Web Browser :)), you get a full blown tablet to boot AND, BONUS!!!!! It's $100 cheaper!

At $100, the Kindle Fire W/Alexa Hands free is a winner.  it's not perfect, but works SO SO much better and it's wicked fast compared to the Show.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_227?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=227&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Echo Show is the PERFECT device for seniors. We purchased this for my 89 year old grandma so my kids could have video chats with their great grandma. BUT, to make/receive video calls (or any sort of call) on the Show, you need to have a smartphone. How many 90 year olds do you know who have a smartphone? If she had a smartphone, we wouldn't need to buy this for her! If they don't have a smartphone, you have to struggle through a bunch of steps to create a fake phone number attached to someone else's smartphone. It can be done, but it's a huge hassle and totally inconsistent with the Show's ""easy to use"" marketing. There is no reason why Amazon can't address this problem. The Show is basically a tablet. Tablets can use programs like Skype or Duo or Hangouts to do video chats without a smartphone. But the Show has this ridiculous barrier for those who don't have smartphones (who also happen to disproportionately be older people--people for whom the Show is supposed to be ideal). I will gladly change this review to 5 stars if Amazon fixes this major problem.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_239?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=239&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My mother is not well, and it's super helpful to be able to have an ""in person"" visit. The only hiccup was getting my dad to remember her name!

We have some other echo deicws and do really like those. The main drawback to the Show - for now - is that it doesn't come close to realizing the potential of its screen. Yes, the video drop-in is nice, but that requires someone else to have a Show. My plan, though, was to have this in the kitchen where I could pull up recipes, websites, videos, etc. In the very early days, there was a hack that allowed me to get to a browser and go from there, but that has since been plugged. We also used to be able to pull up videos, like the ads promised, on all sorts of topics via YouTube. Google apparently made Amazon stop that now as well. So we presently get clickbait news headlines and are able to play music with Amazon Unlimited Music - none of which needs a screen to project anything, it's just audio. Thus, as of right now, this is a glorified Echo or
Dot - not worth it. The possibilities seems to be a bit off, so if you want to order this, lower your expectations and hope that Amazon upgrades the software on this rather than requiring purchase of a new model.

After writing this review, I received a note from Amazon saying they do now have YouTube content available. That appears to be the case, but only temporarily since YouTube content will no longer be available after 1/1/18.

There are already two Amazon echos in our house which we are overall pleased with (4 stars). As for this show, I really would give it 3.5 stars and this is why:

Pros: nice to have a screen, LOVE to see song lyrics, like your linked photos so easily to be viewed (even though the ones you take up and down on phone are considerably smaller), like that you can access prime video content, have read that you can use it for show to show video chat but personally haven't had the opportunity, has a good looking/interesting home screen

Cons: gets confused, says ""something has gone wrong"" regularly, not overly user friendly interface to search/select content in prime video, I repeat my commands a lot more often than to its echo counterparts, the games you can play on it (even with the buttons) are just so so, the voice clarity (for others to hear me) when using it to make calls is poor, the fact that the lowest subscription of music unlimited doesn't apply to the device and it's regularly difficult to understand its voice (pronunciation/inflection)

I hope Amazon is working to improve it...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some of my favorite features are:

-Using Drop In for room to room video intercom calls is excellent and I plan to expand my system to more rooms for this feature alone.

-The family loves having lyrics displayed when they play music

-The viewing angle works well for desk and countertop viewing and the units are solid enough to stay put when you are pressing the touchscreen. A stationary device is a huge improvement over struggling to hold and use a tablet in the kitchen or at your desk.

-The touchscreen and voice complement each other better than I expected. Voice commands put you directly on the screen you want without tapping through layers of menus and the touchscreen makes it easy to select something that would be awkward to articulate as a verbal command.

-Viewing security cameras is an awesome feature and is another reason I will be buying more of these.

-I was also surprised how handy it is to have Alexa show me a numbered list of YouTube videos or my music playlists and then select one by telling her to ""play number x""

Looking forward to getting some more of these!

I use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!

I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn't have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven't thought of!

I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven't figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don't have video screens!

Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free. So now he is a bit worried to use it again. That needs to be fixed.

After looking online, there are ways to trick it temporarily for setup using a smart phone and a second phone number, but it can’t be updated unless you repeat the process and is a hassle.

For my personal use-cases: The Show is fantastic for Spotify, reading, weather, news, alarms, morning routines, as a bluetooth speaker. The Show could be much better for: podcasts, search. Not a big fan of the occasional upselling, and even though I have Spotify as my primary music device, it pulls up Amazon Music sometimes. It also has ""crashed"" once or twice in a month's use.

The Alexa Echo Dot devices throughout my home are amazing in their accuracy and simplicity.  The Show device, on the other hand, has much poorer microphones, and subjects you to a barrage of insultingly stupid ""news"" that you cannot adjust or turn off.

I find myself walking into other rooms to give commands to my Dots rather than deal with the crappy Show device's microphones and thus ability to understand my commands.  And apparently Amazon realizes this, because about 25% of the time when I am standing within 5' of the Show and give a command, the Dot in the adjacent room (40' away, and around two corners) responds instead!  Seriously?  It's frustrating.  I plan on buying another Dot to replace this Show.

Beyond that, the constant barrage of text and news across the Show's display seems to be (a) frequently paid for by P.R. companies (as the content frequently seems designed to draw attention to companies and causes), and (b) is completely stupid and shallow ALL of the rest of the time.  No interesting text or news, just crap about Justin Beaver's latest haircut or some giant turtle that children love (""Alexa, tell me about the gtiant turtle that children love"").  Arrgh! I wish there were a setting to adjust the text & news feed to appeal to people with IQs above 80.

UPDATE 11/6/17:  An Amazon representative called me to discuss the issues discussed in my review.

My whole apartment is now powered by the Echo Show. I purchased Alexa-enabled smart plugs so that I can control my lights with the Show, as well as my TV. I am planning on purchasing one for my family members this holiday season, and I have recommended the Echo Show to at least ten friends in the two weeks that I have owned it.
I am now contemplating purchasing a special microwave by Amazon that can be controlled by Alexa as well, among the list of items that have now peaked my interested since my initial purchase. My fiancé is sufficiently annoyed with me having Alexa turn my lights on and off, but he loves it as well and we both use it daily.
Another great feature is the drop in, we don’t have a particular need for an indoor security camera, but I love dropping in with the Show to see and talk to our pets while I’m gone or at work. My dog has separation anxiety and I love the ability the Show has given me to check in on her.
I regularly purchase things on Amazon, and we are prime members - making the Alexa experience even better. If you are hestitating on whether to buy this system, don’t. I plan on integrating more Alexa enabled devices in our home since purchasing this Show and it is truly a staple in our lives now.

I've just upgraded my wireless router, so perhaps that will help, but, in the meantime, I can ask for an artist or a playlist that is not in my Amazon music and it shuffles the songs. Con: The screen doesn't turn off without a voice command, so it is on till morning. Pro: Small footprint. And as I say, just fun! Oh, and it seems to comfort my cat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Quite useful for seniors living alone.","September 2, 2018","These Shows are very well made as most Amazon devices are and can be pretty fun.  I like the video call feature but know only one other person with an Amazon Spot/Show to contact that way.  There are a TON of skills that you can assign to an Amazon Alexa device but the truth is, after you get over the novelty of it all, you end up using Alexa for just a few things in your daily routine(like weather, news, etc.).  As far as shopping on Amazon via Alexa Show, its a lot easier to use your phone or computer or tablet to be honest.  So, yes I like my Alexa devices and my Show is really fun in many ways but having a Show or other Alexa devices(I have several around my place now), hasn't ""changed"" or ""improved"" my life or made it any more convenient.  I even have most of the lights in my apartment on Wifi so that they are voice operated through Alexa but again, that hasn't translated into increased ease or convenience.  You have to pause and annunciate carefully or Alexa wont understand you sometimes.  And the length of time it takes you to say the phrase frequently takes longer than it would've to reach out and flick the switch. On the other hand, I feel better about having installed an Alexa device in my parents home.  Since its registered in my name, I can drop in on my parents at any time to see if they're ok if I cant get ahold of them otherwise.  My parents can also call out to Alexa to have her call me or anyone else on my contact list in case they ""fall and cant get up"".  The ""home alert"" services which have seniors wear bracelets or necklace buttons are very expensive and require a monthly subscription.  After the initial cost of an Alexa enabled device, all of Alexa's services are free.

So bottom line, Alexa devices and services can be a quick and convenient way to get your daily weather and news and can be a fun way to operate your misc. electronics/lights but for most able bodied youngish folk, she will be more of a cool conversational piece than a life helper.  There will be people out there who would argue this.  People who set up security cameras through Alexa and/or use Alexa for a wide variety of other things but Im talking about ""most"" people.  Not ""those"" people.  For seniors though, Alexa is much more useful and her services are free.  So would I recommend Alexa devices for just seniors?  Heck no!  If you've got the spare bucks then you'll love an Alexa device.  Im just saying that you shouldn't expect any Alexa device to change much about how you orchestrate your life.  She's fun and has a few legitimately useful skills but for most of us, she's mostly just going to be ""fun"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Oldham","Not as good as the original Amazon Echo - delayed verbal processing.","July 13, 2017","So, having returned one Echo Show because of delayed verbal performance, ask Echo a questions, the answer is pushed to the screen within 3-4 seconds but the verbal answer can be delayed by up to 20 seconds, the second unit still seems to have similar issues.

Compare the verbal performance to the original Echo, its woeful.  I could understand that the visual returned info might be delayed, as it's a new factor to the Echo service.
The verbal performance should be just as fast as the original unit and it isn't.  It has the same network access through our firewall as the first Echo unit and we're not seeing any traffic being blocked outbound.

So Amazon either has some flawed units out there or they have changed the process/information flow from the original Echo unit.
If the visual aspect to the show isn't that important to you, I'd recommend staying with the original Audio based Echo, the extra $$ needed for the Show doesn't appear to be a worthwhile spend right now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ll list the negatives first since anyone reading this likely is already aware of the positives owning an echo brings.

-The speaker quality is a huge disappointment. They sound hollow and unimpressive. From best to worst, I’d rank echo speakers as follows: Tap, Echo, Show, Dot. Another issue with the speakers is that you can barely hear a timer going off if you are in another room even if the volume is completely up

-the voice regognition is the worst among all echos as well. Especially if there is any other noise such as a fan running in the kitchen while cooking. Last night I asked it to set a three minute timer but didn’t notice she never responded then I hear a timer alarm three minutes later coming from my living room 50’ away. The dot in there heard me and set the alarm while the show right beside me did not.

-this last point will hopefully be fixed but the software is lame thus far. All I want is YouTube functionality. How is it that I cannot ask it to show me my YouTube subscription list? Or search videos on YouTube.

What I like best is being able to bring things up on the screen news, music,etc.  Mine came with a trial of Amazon music, which I am sure I will continue. The words to the song are there and you can sing along, which is cool Pandora doesn't do that. You can also see videos!  I love the games, and Alexa can answer almost anything. I had the little dot first, and that now lives in my bedroom. Nice to ask the time in the middle of the night etc. I got the Show when it was a TSV on QVC. The downside was it came with a smart plug, which no matter what I did couldn't get it to work, So, other than that, there is no downside except I am stuck with a smart plug I don't use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_220?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=220&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’m also disappointed with the lack of intuitive functionality, as I know android devices can search the web and present results from YouTube easily, and with echo I have to look up a specific command that often doesn’t make sense.

I don't know if I would buy it at full price. It is generally pretty useful, serving as an alarm clock, music system, news on the spot, white noise machine and digital picture frame. There are plenty of other useful ""skills"" that I don't use regularly but allow for a pretty diverse set of functions. I am knocking off the first star because it just isn't and intuitive with language as it should be. For example no matter how I phrase requests for  local news updates, I end up with a national news flash briefing. Other things work great if phrased correctly, but if phrased in an equally correct way just won't work. I am knocking off the other star because of the stupid and intrusive ""things to try"" scroll. I did manage to turn off the stupid news scroll (go to settings, cards and turn off trending topics"") but there is no way to turn of things to try. I just want the clock, temperature and my wallpaper as my default screen. At first I figured I would get used to it, but the suggestions are usually suggesting something I don't care about and don't appear to be personalized. So now  I glance over to see a picture of a loved one or happy memory, I also see a scroll at the bottom telling to try something like making Alexa play Garth Brooks. I don't like Garth Brooks and there is nothing in my music library or search history that would suggest I would. Most suggestions are similarly irrelevant. If you switch to ""do not disturb"" in settings you will lose the scroll while keepoing the clock, but you will also lose your wallpaper. It annoys me a little bit more every day. Please Amazon, give me the option to turn this feature off!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Previously, we had an Echo Dot.  We used it for unit conversion (how many teaspoons in a cup, how many grams in an oz, etc.)  We also listened to music and set timers.
Annoying things about non-Show Echo's:  constantly asking how much time is left on a timer, forgetting the unit conversion because your kids are being brats and distracting your cooking.  Let's be honest - the Echo Dot is not known for good sound quality.  It is just a cheap way to get Alexa into part of your house (nothing against it for what it is either - I have about 8 Dots now).
The Show is amazing.  I can see the big letters across the room.  I can see how much time is left on multiple timers - again, big, easy to read digits.
Sound quality is good.  I don't have a high end audio source to compare it to, but music sounds nice and there is a decent amount of bass coming from the unit.
Other things my wife and I really like:  showing our Amazon photos.  We have a lot of them.  This is a nice way to have it cycle through and add some random decoration to your kitchen (or whatever room you put it in).  I like watching the news broadcast.  We might watch some Amazon Video on it, but not sure how much.  Seeing recipes is nice - although they need a more hands-free way to scroll (like the Fire Cube?)

I would give this a five star if it had support for YouTube.  My family watches a lot of it.  Its a very popular service.  It's a shame it was pulled.  (I guess you can somehow use the web browser to get to it?  If it's complicated, it won't be used and will just frustrate my family.)  I hope this gets resolved or alternative solutions are available in the future.  Let's face it - watching funny dog videos or someone eating expired military rations is entertaining.

I have not used the video camera yet.  I could see this being handy, but currently we have no plans to use this.  I could see this being awesome for talking to older parents/grandparents.

I picked mine up on sale.  For this price, absolutely recommended if you like Alexa.  If it was full price, I don't think I would have bought it unless they offered more skills that really took advantage of the device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can stream live YouTube cams on my Show and I love that feature the best. They add new features all the time and it is a great source of entertainment for me.

The only feature I think would improve it greatly is that it will, for instance, say ""Ask Alexa about the rare albino tiger cub"", but when I ask, it will scroll a short written blurb about the tiger but no picture.

It is so useful. We have it installed in our kitchen and it makes looking up recipes so convenient.

It is useful to play music and or music videos. Another great feature is that it keeps flashing trending news bits on the front page that you can question her to elaborate.

We don't use many of the skills available, but use the core functionality regularly in our daily lives.

My wife was more excited about the Show announcement than I was, so buying a pair to replace/supplant the existing Echoes was inevitable.

The Show does deliver as far as the screen functionality goes. I get: a visible clock, visible weather, visible representations of timers (though the screen will go back to home after a few moments - argh). I can watch videos, though I seldom do.I can rotate through pictures, which we do do. The news snippets are sometimes informative. The sound is good, a little better than the Echo, but not amazing. Basically, it's a slightly more functional version of the original Echo.

Sometimes.

We have one Show on the island in our kitchen. We've discovered that the mic array of the show is MUCH less accurate than the original Echo. The Show is continually mis-interpreting conversation or Television for the wake word. This happened occasionally with the Echo, but the Show mis-interprets the wake word at a rate about 10x that of the Echo. It's become a game to figure what was said that could be possibly interpreted as ""Alexa"" when ""she"" interrupts our conversations.

Also, the feedback for bad interactions seems to have disappeared from the Alexa App. I used to be able to give feedback when Alexa woke incorrectly or failed to deliver results. Perhaps that functionality is still available in the App, but if so, it's buried, and that discourages feedback.

Calling: This is pretty useless to us. We have two different profiles in our house, and a prime family group. If I try to reach my wife at home, and the Show has been left on my profile, I can't make the home Show ""ring"". I can't find a way to change the profile remotely via the App. Show calling calls people, not locations. Sometimes this is what you want, other times it's not. We don't don't use calling because of that; we'll use Facetime instead if we want video calling. That's a shame because the video on the Show is generally better than the phone.

Volume: While there's a buttons and a visual indicator on the screen, I find the original Echo's volume control and level feedback much more intuitive. Adjusting volume on the Echo by voice also seems more effective. Volume levels on the Show seem much less granular.

There's lots of other little things I find annoying about the Show compared to the Echo, and am seriously considering going back to the standard Echo for daily use. The Show still isn't ready for Prime-time use in my opinion.

When reading and writing reviews, the key takeaway for me is always ""Would I/you buy it again"". In my case, the answer for the Show is ""probably not"". That can change if Amazon addresses my concerns via software updates, but that seems less of a priority than rolling out new whizz-bang features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a charming smart device to tell the time and is easy to use to set alarms and play music/sounds or ask questions, but most of the functionality can be done by any Amazon device which leaves the screen being the the stand out selling point. Unfortunately in my case the screen appeared to have a low refresh rate and would flicker a bit as it would fade between information on the screen as if the refresh rate was very low and it wasn't a smooth transition. Then not more than a one to two months after owning it, the screen started to flicker as shown in the uploaded pictures.

While it is possible to sync your google calendar and display events on screen, you must ask Alexa to display it, then it reverts to a blank home screen with Alexa command recommendations and a clock. With a screen that is always on 24/7, it is absurd that there is no way to choose the view you always want on. This is a basic feature, even in those cheap digital picture frames. I thought the timer feature was cool too, but it suffers from the same exact issue. When you set a timer, it does not stay on the timer screen. the system will go back to a useless blank home screen and you have to ask it to display the timer every time you want to see it.

Among the good things about this device are ordering with images, controlling music tracks by pressing a button rather than speaking, and general sound an build quality of the device.

I own 3 Dots (v1 and 2), 2 Echo, 1 Fire TV, 1 Google Home, and now 2 Shows, which are on a whole 'nother league.

Pros:
1. Thanks to Prime Video, I can stream most of my shows on the Echo Show while looking away (who doesn't use their TV like a radio nowadays), which saves on power given that I'm not powering our tv for no reason.
2. The lyrics posting for most songs is my personal jam, as far as features go. It's been very enlightening :)
3. Drop in is fabulous for family, really! But do make sure your wifi is up to snuff. Drop in is also helpful within the household when food is ready.
4. I had been looking for digital picture frames as I digitalise our photos, and I'm so glad that this was able to do double duty.
5. Echo is constantly updating and improving and adding fantastic features. I'm hella pleased.
6. (This is for all echo devices) You can control Fire Stick/TVs with it (while you look for your remote). It'll turn your TV on and open the proper app.

Suggestions:
1. Smart home widgets would be nice on the touch screen. Basically, if Amazon could make cellphones less necessary for automation while at home, that would be swell.
2. Wifi issues with video calls... not really a suggestion, just a statement in need of consideration.
3. Would that this could turn off my TV too, but that's likely wishful thinking.
4. Please make video commands more straightforward and add Netflix/Hulu to your channel options.
5. Some Français would be nice, but I understand that your market in the francophone world isn't the strongest right now. Food for future thought.

...Also, teach Alexa to understand ASMR. She keeps hearing 'a SMR', which is dumb because the phonetics of the English language are such that most of us would say 'an SMR' if we had to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_356?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=356&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have the Dot connected to an external BT speaker and the Show connected to a stereo pair of speakers via BT.

We've purchased an Alexa enabled thermostat, several smart bulbs (used in three rooms of our house) and enabled perhaps a couple dozen Skills. We use the Echo devices for music, shopping lists, general information and weather and even to order Pizza. Recently, we started using the Show and the Dot to make phone calls -- the Show makes for an especially hi-fidelity speaker-phone. Although we typically don't watch movies on the Show, we tried it (accessing our Prime Video Library) and it works great.  Generally, when we're using the Show (in our kitchen) we'll listen to music or a book from Audible.

We're probably barely scratching the surface of what can be done using the Echo/Alexa technology. Every week, so it seems, there is something new that we can do using the Alexa app.  Just for fun, we enabled the ""where is Santa"" skill -- if we had Santa aged kids at home, this would be, I'm sure, a vital skill.  With the stereo set up -- with the Oontz Ultra speakers, the sound quality is quite good, much better than the original Echol speakers -- and, well, it's stereo.

The Show is particularly nice when cooking and multiple timers are set -- you can see the different timers counting backwards on the Show's screen; this one feature alone made the Show less of a novelty (for us, as frequent home cooks).

If you want to dip your toe into the Alexa world, you could start with a Dot (and an external speaker from Oontz) and do it at a relatively small cost.  However, if you think you'd use even a fraction of the ""skills"" the Echo Show has to be the best unit to go with.  If you think you would use ""video calling"" -- somewhat like Facetime or Skype, get one of these for yourself and one for your parents or children or other relatives -- a pair of Shows would be a step up from FT or Skype in terms of quality.

If you just can't wait, these products are available at Best Buy, same price as on-line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_212?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=212&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought it for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It connected easily to our WiFi (we put it on 2G , even though it WILL accept 5G) it paired easily to all our Bluetooth devices.  My husband uses it to put him to sleep at night using the Thunderstorm sound skill, and it works with our Hue lights to wake him up to lights, weather , and a news report.  I was able to pair it with pretty much all our smart home devices and plugs, and by using IFTTT, you can find all sorts of useful ways to use Alexa.

In our first few hours using it , it DID get a bit confused on certain commands, but it turned out it was our incorrect commands that were befuddling it.  We researched and found a list of correct commands , and since then we have had no problems. It seems the more we use it , the faster it responds.

I will be buying another one of these to go in our kitchen.

I do wish you could watch Youtube videos on it, and hope that Google and Amazon can come to some sort of agreement on this in the future, but this is not reason enough for me not to love the Echo Show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I believe just a simple add-on to the software, with the simplicity of a password to allow the Bluetooth pairings, would have been enough, and I'd have saved a headache and one night frustration.

I turned it on and off. I reset the device. I unplugged it and plugged it in again and even looked on the app. I think this is a hardware problem. I hope amazon is willing to rectify the issue.

It is hard to catch with a video but I tried.

I love my new show.

I really like the Echo devices for listening to music through Amazon Music Unlimited.  I was able to buy the the Show at a local store for the under two hundred dollar sale price.  I was some what hesitant to buy the Show as I wasn't sure it offered enough extra features for the price.  There are some features I like and something that I think is not as good as the regular Echo.

Things I like:

1. The screen is clear, bright, and looks good in our kitchen.

2. I never used calendar (Apple Ical) integration with the regular Echo or Echo dot, even though I had it setup.  With the Show, calendar integration is useful as you can use Alexa to add appointments and then see those appointments on the Show.  We share a family calendar and having the appointments on the screen is a nice feature.  The home screen rotates different notices and headlines and will show daily appointments or you can scroll through multiple days.

3.  Weather is nice to see on screen rather than trying to listen to the forecast over speaker on the regular Echo's.  Asking for weather shows todays forecast and the 5 day forecast.  The home screen also shows current weather and temp, a nice feature when getting ready to head out.

4. Pictures- I can use my own picture on the background or load pictures from Amazon photo.  A nice feature as it basically becomes a digital picture frame.

5.  While I don't use the video conference feature yet, I don't know anyone else who has a Show, it would be very useful to connect to my parents with out them having to use Skype or FaceTime.

What I don't like

1. I don't think the sound on the Show is as good as the regular Echo.  The sound is fine but just not as powerful or deep as the regular Echo.

2.  The price is high to me compared to the Echo.  With the new Echo being under hundred dollars, the Show is too much more money just for the screen features.  With sound being less than the Echo, if you are using Echo's for mostly music, I would stay with the lower priced 2nd Gen Echo.  Amazon needs to get the price of the Show down to about $175 in my opinion.  If not, then Amazon needs to improve the speakers in the next generation Show.

While I like the Show and what it offers, the price is prohibitive to make this a must have.  I know a lot of people are upset about the YouTube removal from the Show, but I have no interest in using YouTube on the show as I listen to music through Amazon Music and I can watch YouTube on TV, iPad, Computer, Phone etc.  Not necessary, for me, to have YouTube on the Echo.  Maybe Google and Amazon will work through their issues and put it back on before long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Never understands watch Showtime show Chi only responds that it can’t play Showtime, even though it had played it before.  Very frustrating.  Doesn’t play Youtube.

The drop in feature which could be intrusive, is actually a useful feature for caregivers and families who can drop in and check on their loved one. Voice commands are also much easier for elderly. The Alexa artificial intelligence, is however, not as well developed as Google. As a result it still does not understand many questions. You can request songs to be played on youtube but is has difficulty finding anything that has a ""non English title"", nor is there a search feature once in youtube that would permit a manual search. You don't have control of any of the apps available. No batteries means that you have to plug in and wait for it to reload every time you decide to change locations and therefore not practically mobile. I have not used its smart home features and can not comment on their usefulness. For those who have their smart phones and tablets and are reasonably tech savvy, Echo show really does not offer any practical benefits. It is just another cool toy :) I, however, do see a market for using Echo show for the elderly and their caregivers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_82?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=82&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do a lot of complicated recipes so I can set the timer when I cook and play music at the same time, or play one of the games. Love it. Often I am on the phone with my brother at the other side of the country when a timer goes off. He thinks it's hilarious when I tell Alexa to stop or when I ask it for information pertaining to one of our discussions. For me, Alexa is a harbinger of things to come. I have two robots, a Braava and a Roomba. I haven't linked them yet, but I'll get around to it. Imagine the home of the future, where the most mundane of all house hold chores gets done for you, either by pre-scheduling on a device or by telling that device what to do. Alexa is a segway to that. It won't be very long before you load clothes or dishes into a machine and then tell the machine the settings you want it to use and it does it.

Individually they were $100 off each, but if you bought in the black and white bundle they were $220 off. I didn’t want them to sell out so I had to buy them individually because of the “Prime Day Crash”... and I missed out on my extra $20 savings.

Other than my big disappointment with amazon prime day, these are the 5th and 6th echo’s I’ve bought for my home (I’ve bought 7 total - 1 being a gift for my dad). I have a 5bed 3bath house and between the 3 dots, 1 tower, and now my 2 shows, my house runs smoothly with Alexa working all my lights in the house, door locks, garage, my TVs, my indoor and outdoor cameras, the theater.... including playing lullaby’s for my children at night until they fall asleep, and cracking jokes with them “Alexa tell me a joke”, Alexa has become my bonafide house manager/mom-assistant.

Now if she could just feed my kids, I’d be one ecstatic Customer.

Thank you for all you do, Alexa. I’m a working Mom of 6 year old Twin girls and a 2 year old boy.... when I’m running out of my house at 7am with 6 bags on my shoulder and I shout “Alexa turn off all lights”, and you turn off every single light upstairs and downstairs so I don’t have to take the extra 5+ minutes it takes to do it.... a lifesaver.

After a couple of calls between the two units, I can say that I'm satisfied that my reason for buying has been justified. Call quality was excellent; no breakup (pixelation) such as Skype calls are afflicted with, decent video resolution, no voice/video sync issues, no lag. Works better than I expected for this function. A minor niggle under CONS. A secondary reason I wanted the SHOW is for viewing my five Arlo cams on demand. This also works well enough, though the skill could use a little tuning. I'm sure that will happen. The only issue with it is that there is some delay while ""Connecting to Netgear"", which can't be blamed on the Echo. Same thing happens when checking cams from my phone, or even from my DT which is in the same room as the Arlo hub (with both hardwired via Ethernet.) Also a Netgear issue is that it sometimes takes more than one try to connect to a camera. Netgear should probably try to fix this issue, it's longstanding. But I digress. The skill COULD display multiple cameras at once, as you see on the phone app and the web app. But it doesn't. Maybe someday. My major beef (revision 2017.07.29) is that my home automation control has become randomly flaky, unreliable, particularly with Wemo devices. I Could blame Wemo, since their app maybe the worst of all time, but all Wemo devices are currently working fine with the Wemo app and another lighter-weight 3rd party app. Something has changed within the last 24 hours. I've iupdated all apps, device firmware, re-booted both router and cable modem, and re-discovered devices within the Alexa app...they all discover, but respond randomly or not at all. This complaint isn't specific to the Show device; I have to original Echos (tall) and three Dots as well. Same problem with all, but I thought I would throw this in because, for home automation, and for the time being, the Alexa/Echo ecosystem for use with a heavily Wemo'd home is useless. I will revise again later, if Amazon gets it fixed.
Other pros and cons, subject to revision after the device SW and skills mature:

PROS:
YouTube
Lyrics onscreen when playing from Prime Music
Photo slideshow from your Prime Photos as a homescreen background, if you want
Speakers are very decent for voice and quite decent for music (also a CON; see below.)
Can display calendar appointments on demand (Google Calendar used.)
Drop-In feature works well for room-to-room intercom.
Seems to reconnect & become usable more quickly than tall Echos and Dots when unplugged & moved.
Solidly built, pleasing aesthetic (I bought black.)
Bright screen, touch sensitivity a little low for me...an adjustment in settings would be nice.

CONS:
Speakers (also a Pro; see above.) The speakers are very directional, covering the 180 degree arc in front of the SHOW well, but sound quality drops dramatically as soon as the listener moves to the side or rear of the unit. This primarily affects music quality. If it's up against a wall or in a corner, should be fine, but we keep ours on the kitchen counter which is open to great room, and behind the device music is thin, flat, watery. To be expected, I guess, with speakers oriented toward a screen viewer. We've been spoiled by the sound from the tall Echos. One located in the center of the great room provides excellent coverage throughout that area and the kitchen as well, with no directional blind spots. Definitely our choice for music. Stick with the tall Echo for great streamed or BT music. We rarely use our Bose BT or the Big Jambox we've had for years anymore...Echo tall is that good. As good as Bose/Big Jambox? No, not quite, but very close. Besides, if you want to use your favorite BT music speaker paired with the SHOW, you certainly can.
Home screen: Inability to have granular control over what's displayed on HOME screen. I HATE that SHOW rotates through a bunch of unwanted and unneeded suggestions on what to ask Alexa, overprinted onto my chosen BG images (photo slideshow.) LET US TURN THAT OFF! I called Amazon CS, and the guy was great, spent about 30 minutes with me, but neither of us could turn it off. Minor niggle...the screen darkened during a lengthy video call as part of SHOW's screensaver logic, and I couldn't get it to brighten again without rebooting after the call. Amazon should definitely write into the OS so that the screen NEVER darkens when a video call is in process. How hard can that be? Also, I read that the inactivity screen darkening is supposed to see new activity around the device and brighten again on approach; it's flaky, unreliable at present. Needs a tune-up.

ALL IN ALL, I'm UNhappy with the purchase, but here's a REALLY, REALLY BIG THING for Amazon, and one that would send the sales of ALL Echo devices through the roof, and probably kill the Google Home to boot: Being able to listen to a music stream on all or selected multiple devices throughout the house. Goggle Home can do this. Right now we have two tall Echos, three Dots, and one Show. If Amazon would enable synced music streaming, I would have a device in every room, and as a side benefit to Amazon, I might subscribe to Prime Unlimited Music instead of just using the free Prime Music.

I'm sure I'll have updates after a few more weeks of use. BTW, I've had two SW updates not including the initial one on first boot, so I know they're working on stuff.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_246?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=246&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Setup is easy, when you first plug it in everything is setup using the touch screen (easier then using the app). If you don't have your phone on you can also ask Alexa to show the settings and configure the Show just like you would with the app.
I personally have mine in the kitchen so that I can listen to music but also use the screen to watch movies/tv shows and have Alexa bring up recipes for me. Or just have her display my orders, to-dos, weather etc.
When I first got mine it wouldn't work with other echos for multi-room music until I updated it. Which you can do by asking your Show to bring up the settings and have it update from there. Also I couldn't find this option in the phone app, only on the Show it self.

To me, it's a slick and handy device, and an ingenious look into the future.  Though the touch screen is not very sensitive, the Show is best used as a voice command device in any event.  The screen resolution and sound are both quite good in my view, though I use Alexa to control my Sonos speakers, which  some people somewhat unfairly tried to compare its sound too.  Come on.  As far as the microphones go, I'm kind of amazed at how far I can be from the kitchen counter where I keep the Show, and still have Alexa respond by (most of the time) turning on and off the requested lights.  It seems that the kitchen is probably the most logical place to keep this for many people, so you can do, see, and hear almost anything while working there.  And doesn't it seem that the kitchen usually turns out to be the most frequent gathering place during get togethers?  I mean the food and the wine are there, so why no Alexa?  It's a good conservation piece during parties, since many guests are unlikely to have seen this thing up close.  There are probably valid privacy concerns, and if so, you can easily disable the camera and the somewhat creepy drop in feature.  Still, in this day and age, we have to be willing to accept some degree of intrusion into our lives if we choose to be connected at all.  A personal choice of course.  Overall, this is a very cool, elaborate device that is a lot of fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This feature only works when the other person has the amazon app downloaded on their smart device.  Again, not entirely helpful.

The Echo Show is the buggiest Echo product I own (and I own them all.)

Example:  the screen will not clear my message about package delivery.  This cuts my screen size by 1/3.  I've tried to clear it, yet it persists.  The Alexa App won't let me turn off Amazon package notifications.  Even when I turn the screen off, the message remains.  When I play a movie, it remains.  Anyway, you get the picture.  You might want to wait until the bugs are worked out.

Update 8/31/18 - Amazon has indeed worked out these bugs and the Show is working swimmingly now.  As a result, I will update my rating from a 3 to a 4 star.

Video in general is great, but the drop in feature is what shines. Grandma's are technically not so savvy, so I've set them up in each of their homes allowing us to drop in on them, but not vice versa. That means when the little ones want grandma they get grandma... but grandma won't get us unless we want her to.

If you don't follow what I'm saying, there's setup in Alexa app for each device owner that identifies if the calls/drop ins you are receiving get auto-answered or if you have to accept the call. When we call grandma it automatically picks up and we are immediately looking at their living room or office. When they call we can pick up or refuse the call giving our household some measure of privacy control. Is that imbalance, year, but it works. Hopefully nobody's walking around naked when we call the grandparents.

Taking away youtube was a huge decrease in value/function if you ask me. If you are ok with technology you can setup systems for your family and video calls from across country are great!

Cons:
- You can have family photos as the back ground but they are dimmed due to the floating text and I cannot seem to find options to adjust that.
- you cannot use the touch screen to adjust the show settings in anyway. This must all be done via app remotely
- if you ask about Technology, It seems Amazon has partnered up with some companies to give B.S. opinions. The GTX 1050TI is not the best graphics card available! (of my soap box)

Pros:
- Having the Show connected to you Gmail account lets you see upcoming events in your calendar on display.
- Once figured out, calling or dropping in on other Show/Alexa devices is fun. Family lives in California and I live in Okinawa Japan and everything runs smoothly. All I do is say ""alexa call mom"" and it does its thing.
- Sounds great. Music is loud and has base/depth.

Functionally, it does not do much more than the original Echo.  It would be more useful if I subscribed to the various Amazon services, Music, Photos.  As it stands, it is a good music player.

Here is Epic Fail #1, Alexa will not play Spotify to a multiroom group via voice command.  Spotify app on my phone will allow me to choose a multiroom group to play to.  Lack of voice command seems to defeat the convenience factor.  That glitch needs to be fixed.

Epic Fail #2.  The White Echo Show comes with a BLACK CORD.  A black cord against light walls in the kitchen is an eyesore.  Worse?  Customer service doesn’t know the white Show ships with a black cord. I actually exchanged black Show for white Show to get a white cord at the suggestion of Amazon customer service representative.

We also have 7 Phillips hue bulbs, a nest thermostat, nest security system with camera and 3 smart WiFi plugs.

I will honestly say that there is little to no menu systems in the echo show which was super disappointing, you can’t flip through it and change things whatsoever it all has to be done on the app, which is a mediocre app at best. I was hoping for streaming options on the show besides amazon video or just better options like Netflix or Hulu YouTube etc, maybe cooking channel for me and my girlfriend to watch while cooking? Idk, there’s not even really clear instructions for what it can do just what you can ask it.

The bottom line for me is that we already have 4 echos in a small apartment that play music fine and control devices fine, not always great which needs work, but now we have this new device with a screen that does most of the same but has a ultra limited screen that has tons of potential but little actual use, the device doesn’t even cover the hub that the echo plus has. :/

Amazon, without YouTube support this thing sucks, I’ll be honest, I’m returning mine, I don’t want browser based support for my products, I want REAL support, get it together, and stop asking me to subscribe to amazon music, it sucks, Spotify is way better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When using the Drop in feature on any other device your cell phone app has a speaker button.  When you drop in on the Echo Show the speaker button goes away and you get a button to disable video.  One might argue the only device you need a speaker button for is the show because it is the only device you need to communicate with while looking at your smart phone.

Cons first: when compared to the pairing system of the echo and echo dot, this thing doesn't work anywhere near as well for pairing. You can't pair with your mobile, which makes it somewhat painful if you have a wifi pw that happens to be a 26 character hexadecimal. Add in that the firmware update failed 3 times, due to a ""slow connection"". Probably Amazon's firmware servers were slow, as I tested my bandwidth at 50mbps down sustained. As far as use: screen is a bit small for something you have setting down.

That's it for the cons. Like I said, setup was painful.

Pros: The sound quality is astonishing (it had better be for the price). The screen quality and touch response is quite good. The tip displays are great and very useful. The skills are expanding more, so that's rather nice. Of course, one of the major reasons I got it was for Ring integration. It works well, though I'm disappointed that sometimes I have to issue the command twice... Once to wake the camera, then again to show it. Why can't it just issue the wake command to the doorbell, then wait? Probably Ring's fault on that... Wait, this is the pros section.

I've found this to be an ideal nightstand device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_281?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=281&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like to see some of the results I ask for (three-day weather forecasts, lyrics to songs) and it is nice to have Amazon videos available. The killer app for me (the one that got me to buy it) is the videos to go along with recipes. I am a challenged cook, and seeing step-by-step instructions is nice: BUT, the screen times out too quickly, and I have to start at the beginning of the recipe once I get back in (infuriating!). There is also no way to tell which recipes have video until I get into specific recipes to see, which is tedious.

Most frustrating, the Echo Show doesn't support key services that would make it most useful. Skype and YouTube are essential for a video device, and the lack of those two significantly reduces the value of the Echo Show.

My general complaint about Alexa is that it does a terrible job recognizing classical music titles. When I want to listen to classical music, I either have to build a playlist in Amazon Music with the music I want (time consuming) or switch to my Google Home Mini (which is much smarter about classical music).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then I re-read the listing and immediately bought it. After I set it up, which was extremely easy, and the right size for my taste, I couldn't believe the quality and features available with my Prime account, so I immediately bought a second one. With my Prime account they have so much to offer. I Love the on screen Lyrics at 67 I feel eighteen again after my two strokes I don't have to remember I can see the words so I can sing along(LOL). If someone is looking for a great device they should definitely buy a Gen 1 or Gen 2 Show Generation 2 are the only ones you will find unless you look hard). The capabilities are simply FANTASTIC!  The screens are clear and bright and the sound is incredibly bright and strong with great bass and if you want to customize the screen and sound you have brightness and equalizer controls. Although I haven't experienced the 10"" screen on the Gen 2 Show, It can't be less than what you get on the great 7"" screen on the Gen 1. So Go and get the future right now!

Half The screen display had lines across it.  I would turn it off and back on after 10 minutes. Itwould be ok for a few weeks and then start the problem again. Most recent problem is the screen will freeze up in the middle of asking a question.  I have found the Echo Show to be very disappointing in performance and reliability.  It constantly answers to the TV in the other room but never to me. I have to say “Alexa” first to get its attention and most of the time it answers with “I don’t know”, “I don’t understand” or my favorite is “I’ll have to look that up” and then I get nothing.  I tried and tried again to do the voice training but it never has positive results.  If I place a call through it, the other party won’t answer because they think it’s a Spam call. I can figure out how to chance the caller ID to my number and not the 800 number it uses.  Just recently I returned it after 8 months of frustration. It was still under warranty. I’ll see if the replacement unit is any better. Otherwise, it makes a great “paper weight” or a good time and weather announcer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I read specs. on the unit and knew I could make use of this device. I made the purchase and am very happy with it. I check weather daily, check top stories in the news, I ask questions that come to mind when i'm bored, I ask for recepies, I play music alllll the time, I watch trailers for prime movies,this Echo Show does it all, i'm not a huge techy but I do all rite , it took me 10 minutes to set up and be running. I have had it 3 days and already purchased a 2nd one for the bed room and that took all of about 5 minutes to set up. I have read dozens of revues and it seams the I phone Apple folks seam to be the harshest critics, I am an PC. guy and an Android Phone user and I have to say this is probably the coolest addition to my home and i'm in a lot of homes

I plan on upgrading with lighting and a couple cameras and probable a thermostat to run off my Echo Show. Also like an other person who wrote a review I have a mother in a retirement home that is cell phone challenged an livs 1400 miles away and i'm planning on installing one in her room soo I can video call and check in with her, all she would have to do is Say (Alexa Answer Call). Soo for me a remodeling contractor who is in many homes and see a lot of trends come and go I think we could most all agree this technology is here to stay and all the little quirks will be worked out as Alexa gets smarter as time goes by.. She seams to be getting my traits in just a few days.. I would recommend this unit to any of my friends or clients..

When I have my hands tied up with the baby or doing other tasks that take up a majority of my attention, it's great to have her there to play music, ask questions, and delegate tasks.

I only have one complaint about the Echo Show, which I saw in many, many other reviews while doing my research before purchasing, which is that it cannot play YouTube videos. I understand competitive markets and not wanting to directly promote the use of a competitor's product. But honestly, this would hands-down be a 5 star product if it had that capability. I hope in the future that Amazon will allow for this to be a skill on the Echo Show after seeing the public demand for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I spent 45 min on the phone with customer service and Echo support doing reboot and factory resets with no change or improvement. So now instead of Amazon sending a replacement, they want this device sent back for repair...If the service center can't fix the issue they'll replace it.

My most recent was a Google Home. The Google Home had too many issues and was not consistent. Also, my Hue lights would not work consistently so, after using the Google Home for a month, I decided to go back to Amazon Echo.
Initially, when I first heard they released the product, I figured they were “reaching” in terms of a product rollout. Then I started to see the reviews on Youtube and started getting interested and my thought of Amazon “reaching” was starting to go away.

The Amazon Show is more useful than I thought. Having the screen is a great thing if you like to see things visually. For example, when you want to see how much time is left on the timer, what is on your grocery list, a scrolling feed of top news stories or the weather and time. In terms of watching videos and such, the screen is about the same size as the Iphone 7 Plus or Galaxy S8+.

Overall, comparing it to the Echo, I think the $50 extra for the display is worth the money. While I do not use the video screen all the time, its useful to have when you want to see something visually.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From setting timers, to displaying recipes, and even getting updated on recent news, the Show can help you get a little more accomplished by acting as your personal assistant. The drop-in function is amazing, and has great image and audio quality. I use it daily to check in with the family and to just check on the Home. The ability to control other smart devices is a very useful feature, by the way of acquiring “skills” in the Alexa app, but the list of available skills is still growing, and there is no real easy way of seeing which skills are available, say if a family member wants to use it. Skills are activated by very precise wording, which can make it a pain if you don’t use it as often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_331?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=331&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All the old features I won't rehash but with Echo Show my news flash briefing in the morning is now like a little TV newscast just for me. I would like to see a few more regions added for local news but most states have a larger participating news station that will do for now. People said before this came out that the screen would be too small to enjoy watching Amazon Video or any videos for that matter. Actually the screen is much larger than I thought and the convenience is NOT having additional space wasted by having a large screen in the kitchen.

YouTube is a great source for background music, having easy to find, extended-play (10+ hours or streaming ‘live’) music available. I was very disappointed with regards to the Echo SHOW’s inability to directly access YouTube; can be done, but very cumbersome and difficult to navigate to the desired selections.

• Initial set-up extremely easy
• Voice recognition is very good, even in a noisy environment with background music playing.
My CONs:
• Voice-only control can be very frustrating for complex inputs/requests
• Lack of external keyboard connection ability
• Answers are very short and lacking in detail
• Alexa’s AI needs more development (see my comments, below).
My WANTs:
• YouTube . . . Please !
• Keyboard connect ability as a secondary input (via ‘Bluetooth’ or USB)
• Audio output (low level, stereo) jack for connecting a powered external speaker system for better sound quality.
As noted above, I also have some reservations with respect to the ‘answers’ provided by Alexa. I personally (others my feel differently) that ‘answers’ are just too short, incomplete, and sometime WRONG (or at least, misleading). A prime example is my question regarding Gold:
Question: “How much does one cubic centimeter of Gold weigh?”
Answer: “There is 0.043 pounds of Gold in 1 milliliter.” While this answer could be correct UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, I consider it to be WRONG (IMHA)! This Q/A is an indication of AIexa’s inability to properly interpret the question ‘in context’ with common practice, and also to totally disregard the need for ‘qualification’. Alexa should realize that “Gold”, being a precious metal, traditionally uses the TROY weight system, NOT the standard AVOIRDUPOIS system. Thus, the best ‘correct’ answer is 0.0517… Troy Pounds (or, better yet, 19.32 . . grams, which is the weight of one cubic centimeter of Gold (equal in grams to the Specific Gravity). Also, weight-per-volume needs to be qualified as to temperature (and, for gases, pressure). In addition, although “milliliter’ and ‘cubic centimeter’ are equal ‘volumes’, the use of ‘milliliter’ is a bit ‘off-track’ since ‘milliliter’ is normally used in reference to ‘liquids’ not ‘solids’.
In summary, the Echo Show may serve the needs of many purchasers, but I found it to not meet my expectations or requirements. Alexa, and Artificial Intelligence in general, is fairly new and will continue to evolve. At some point I may ‘revisit’ this device, but for now: bye-bye Alexa.

Accidentally omitted mention of using a small Bluetooth keyboard with my Fire 8 HD tablet / powered speaker mention in the above review; the keyboard makes input a lot more convenient and faster.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_418?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=418&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The initial reviews seemed a little lackluster, and the price ($229) is quite high. I wasn't sure what the screen could really add to Alexa for that price. When it dropped to $150 for the holidays, I bought one. So, if you already have an Echo, I think you will have reasonable expectations. Does the screen add a lot? Not really. But it is nice. The screen will rotate through your calendar, the temperature, and links to some interesting stories and videos. If you ask for the weather, it will display the full week. You also get the real feel tempurature. If you set a timer, it will rotate through that too. I think this works really well in the kitchen, but I have multiple Echos and I don't see a reason to replace the others with an Echo Show. So if you know what an Echo does, you should like the Show. Just don't expect it to be something else. It doesn't currently support YouTube, but I can't really see myself using that a lot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_182?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=182&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.
Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests...

Echo Show brings me  everything I  love about Alexa, and now she can show me it all as well on a beautiful, bright, colorful screen.  I can watch videos, flash briefings,  see music lyrics, security cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, browse and listen to Audible audiobooks,  and all of this is hands free.  All I have to do is ask Alexa.  I use her to find out how to spell words, make hands free video calls,
and instantly connects to other Echo devices around your home so I can tell Alexa to turn off and on my lights.
Alexa plays my songs,  and she streams over my in home Wi-Fi.  The speakers are exellent quaility  Dolby processing for crisp vocals and extended bass response .  I am even able to adjust the treble, mid, and bass levels with my  voice.
I have not connected any cameras yet, but may try that soon since that is possible,.  With eight microphones, beamforming technology, and noise cancellation, Echo Show hears me  from any direction—even while my music is playing which I love.  There are numerous skills and I one of my favorites is that i have here connected with my XM Radio account so I can listen to my XM Radio through Alexa.  I love this item and I highly recommend.

After having for slightly over a week, I've run into a problem with the Alexa SiriusXM skill. I have an account with full access on Sirius that includes full computer/device access. I've add the this option to Alexa and Alexa tells me it's linked. I ask her to play something like 80's on 8 and she tells me my subscription doesn't cover that. So I ask her just to play ch8. Then she tells me ""something is wrong"" but she won't say what. I've spent a good deal of time with Sirius making sure it's not their issue. I've spend just as much time with Alexa support on Tuesday. I was told it was being sent to the development team, and that I would be contacted back within 24 to 48 hours. Now 36 house later, still no contact as I was promised by the person helping me Tuesday. I've never had problems with any of my previous Amazon devices, but this one is a challenge. I feel that I upgraded my Sirius subscription for nothing as I can't use it on Alexa as I had expected.

We like the availability of a screen at the breakfast table, for our 3 year old. She’s very much into movies - and ones that we enjoy, too. So, it’s a benefit in our house. We also use it to cast music throughout the house using Groups of other Echo devices around the house. In some ways, the Show is fun, but very limited.

It’ll play music you’ve connected to your account - like Pandora. And, it’ll play albums from Amazon Music. It can play a radio station, like your local NPR station, and gives a fairly decent weather forecast. But, that’s. about. it.

You’d think they’d have built in Fire TV features to a touchscreen video player. But, no. No access to download Netflix or Hulu, or any apps at all for that matter. Even an SD slot in the back would’ve made a ton of sense. But, again, no. It’s basically an Amazon only devise. With a few, very few, exceptions.

It’s command recognition is beginning to feel antiquated as well. I know, for a technology that’s so new, I’d assume it has better capabilities. It barely knows how to play/pause what your watching or listening to.

Alexa knows how to pause a video, I’ll give them that. But, it doesn’t know how to continue playing. “Alexa, pause,” works fine. To continue playing, with the video or music paused on the screen, one would assume “Alexa, Play,” would be the right command. Instead, that command forces the software to start playing some random playlist.

Without a major update soon, I can smell the obsolencense of this device a mile away. And, that’s too bad. I’m sure it’s due to be replaced very soon, and it will end up in the trash like a lot of other tech junk these days. A BIG update is the only saving grace of the Show.

I’d steer clear if I were considering this device now. And, go with a tiny monitor you can mount on a wall with an Amazon Fire plugged it. This way you can enjoy many more features and capabilities.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Because YouTube isn’t part of it anymore (and I knew that before buying it )but figured there would be other videos to watch. I do a lot of DIY projects. This doesn’t bring up anything I ask it. I’ll ask Alexa please show me cocoa butter Lotion, chapstick,or body wash recipes,whatever I plan on making and so forth but it will bring up baking recipes for cookies or other things instead. I can get everything on my iPhone so I really don’t even need this for that. I figured it be easier instead of getting my phone all gross while making my products.
I used it a few times to call my sister because she has one too. I also used it for the drop in for when I’m away to check on my house and my cats. Though the noise it makes scares them. while my sister was taking care of my house while I was a way last week, when I called her on it, she said my voice was distorted and it was making a weird high pitch sound. I couldn’t hear it on my end though. So maybe something is wrong with it?  Since I’m not getting much use out of it as I thought I would, I may end up returning it. It’s expensive to just sit on my table or counter collecting dust. The commercials made it look really neat and useful. Also, everything else extra for it like the outlets to turn lights on and the cameras are pretty expensive. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to afford to buy them in the future. I guess I should’ve done more research before purchasing. I got it on Inpulse bc the price was cheaper and the sale wasn’t gonna last much longer that day, plus I was able to set up a payment plan which made it much more affordable. I’ll have to think about it some more to see if I really want to keep it. As of now, it’s pretty useless. The camera part to check in on my house, I can do with my tablet and a free app. So that will cost me nothing.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_459?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=459&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Harron","Exceeded my expectations!","July 22, 2018","When I purchased the Echo Show, I had low expectations as to it's use.  The main reason I wanted it was to see who was at the door for my Ring Door Bell, when some one rang the door bell.  Based on the reviews I read, I realized I could not talk through Echo to someone at the door, but I could only see who was at the door.  For me that was enough.  The Echo Show accomplished that need and it does it with minimal delay.
After playing with Echo Show,  I realized there is so much more to this device that I really liked.  I like being able to play Amazon Music and request any song and genre I want.  I enabled Sirius XM and now I can play all Sirius channels as if I had a Sirius radio (you do have to have a printed list of the channels and request the specific channel you want to play).  I like being able to look up and use recipes on All Recipes.com.  It is really great how it steps thru the recipe while I am cooking.  Love being able to listen to my Audible books on the device.  I appreciate being able to get weather and traffic conditions on the fly.  The timer is very useful in the kitchen.  Every day I am enabling new things that the Echo Show can do.  For the price I paid for this device, I think it is fantastic and I am considering buying another one for my bedroom in place of my alarm clock.  I am surprised Apple had not come up with something like this sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_55?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=55&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Currently I am using it in my office and it is making a good assistant.  The best part of the show is that it is combining the Alexa App features, the Echo, and my google calendar into one device.  I don't use video calling at this time so I can't write about those features and I don't use any apps at this time.

I think Amazon missed one important feature that could really be useful to the disabled community.  There should be a feature that allows the user to touch which app, such as Spotify or Pandora, without having to use voice commands.  This feature would also be useful for playing Amazon Music or Videos; there are people who cannot speak and adding this feature would allow for them to use this device.  If this is a feature that is already on the Show I haven't found it yet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_172?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=172&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Being an Apple family, we hadn’t really even heard much or researched the Echo line at all. So, I will say that we opened the box with zero expectations and weren’t disappointed with the lack of YouTube, since we didn’t find out that was originally included until a few days later. Not knowing that it was supposed to be a feature, we didn’t feel as let down as some other reviewers.

The Show was really easy to setup, and we had it online within minutes. The hardest part, which wasn’t even that hard, was navigating the Alexa app for iPhone and trying to find where all of the settings were to get the device tuned in how we wanted (for example, allowing our household to drop in but not anyone else). A few times, the app did not want to save my address for things like updating traffic and weather, but I just kept trying and eventually it stayed in there. Not really a problem with the Show itself, but can be annoying as you try to get ready to try out all of the features.

Staying home with a 4 year old means that I’m usually always doing SOMETHING, and most of that with my hands full. The ability to just talk to Alexa and add items to my shopping list while cooking lunch and dinner is amazing. Turning up music on a quality speaker, skipping songs, or even changing the station with a few words is great. Watching videos on a clear screen that is surprisingly great quality while meal prepping has been my favorite. Especially after my husband and son took over the living room TV with their Christmas gaming console, I can still watch my Prime Videos in the kitchen while I’m getting things done. Now, I will say that I had the ability to ask Siri for things before, but half the time my phone is across the room or in the bedroom on the charger. Having a dedicated screen and speaker on the kitchen counter while my hands have chicken juices on them means I actually USE the voice feature all the time now.

In the near future, we plan to add smart products like LED light strips, WiFi enabled lightbulbs, security cameras, and maybe even the Harmony remote. I’m pretty excited about the possibilities of integrating so much, especially as we consider adding another baby to the family.

Things we love-
Great quality sound that doesn’t distort as the volume gets louder
Great video quality for the screen size
Ease of use
Easy to set up
Tons of skills to set up and explore

Things that could be improved-
Chargeable battery to take to another room easily
Camera angle adjustment for small kids using the video call feature
Design that allows easy mounting to a wall if low on space
Easier trigger words for skills, or an easier way to change what Alexa defaults to when we use certain phrases would be great. For example, I use Our Groceries, but if I just tell Alexa to add something to the list, it defaults to the native shopping list. The ability to change that would be perfect!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_206?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=206&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can be cooking in the kitchen and talk to my mother as she's cooking in her kitchen. It picks up voices from across the room and delivers clear and Crisp audio every time. One example of how well this picks up audio, my brother actually went into the other room and some through a closed door and I could still hear him! I actually prefer to call on it in over my cell phone. Video quality can fluctuate with connection, but overall, I am so pleased with this. As a side note, you actually can call any phone number using the echo show, but only Alexa app users can get a video call. I even use it to call my mother on her regular cell phone. I enjoy the other features, and find it easy to use with playing content from Amazon, namely audio books, movies, music, etc. The sound quality is very good in my opinion, the closest I may ever come to owning a bose. Jk, not quite that good, and Maybe others will correct me, but I find it has good sound. Also, if definitely fills a room. I cannot believe I have lived so long without this in my life! Also, I own a Dot, and can honestly say that the pickup on sound is not nearly as good, and the sound quality is acceptable. I use my dot to set alarms at night and remind myself of things.

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player I've been generally very happy with my Amazon experience, but I must say this echo show has been a serious pain in the rear. Purchased in June I believe and then in August it started having this flickering horizontal line that drove me nuts. I connected with support they said we have to send it in and there's nothing else that can be done. I send it in, and after them having it a week they started calling me back. When I was able to talk and they called we chatted and came to find out they called to see how it was. I told them I haven't received it yet. The agent then said he was calling to see when he could call me again to check in on it. ""So you're calling me to see if you can call me?"" I was pretty irritated with them, he couldn't tell me what was wrong with it but told me when I could expect it back.

When I did receive it, it was better for awhile. In reading the notes it said they reloaded the firmware and it was all good. 1) why didn't they ask me to do that? 2) It's not all good, now a month later, it's doing it again but even worst. I attached a still pic and small movie of effect it's having now.

If I could return it I would, but I'm outside of the window now. Very unhappy so minimally I hope I can give pause to someone on the fence that minimally you get a couple year protection plan via squaretrade or something because I have 0 faith in this lasting a full year.

If you are in a long distance relationship, this can work wonderfully. However, it does have some limitations.

1. It's bulky.
2. It always needs to be plugged in.

These first two are important if you like moving it around from room to room.

3. There is no feature that allows you to turn the microphone off-- and the microphone only. Sometimes (during video chats), I don't want to turn the camera off, but I have to press the dual microphone camera button. Why is it that there's a video off button on the screen and not a microphone off button? Phones have this feature, come-on now Amazon.

Here are things I really like about it:
1. Amazing screen size and quality. I like to watch flash briefings every morning as an alternative to watching the news.

2. The speakers rock. I love how I can listen to my audiobooks and Spotify music as loud as I want. I usually have it on high while I move around the house.

3. How I can connect it to my home security system and smart plugs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_203?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=203&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First it seemed that it may be a glitch due to the wi-fi connectivity that will go away. It was on and off then, but now the screen is shimmering constantly. I heard that this is a known issue with the first generation of Show devices. I called Amazon but the don't take the device for refund or exchange - it's been 1 month over their 6 months refund policy.
If there is a manufacture issue with the first generation products, should not the vendor at least make an exchange? The item in not cheap ($229+tax) just to get stuck with a malfunctioning/deficient product. I have 4 Alexa devices at home but now I am thinking about switching to other brands with a better customer support. At this point, there are plenty out there...

Yet, it could still play well if Amazon would/could re-allow youtube (and maybe add apps for other common video services like netflix, hulu, etc.).  Also, could the AI/UI be enahanced to do things like ""Alexa, play season 3 of ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Alexa, show me the episode list of ""Futurama""?  And why can't I (re)configure my Show from within the Show itself?  (And don't get me started on the quirks that pop up if there's been a network interruption...)

Try ""Alexa, play music for cleaning.""

Try ""Alexa, tell me a riddle.""

I purchased Echo Shoe becasue I have a leaning disabled son who lives in a home away form me.  I do not get to see him more than once every 6 weeks or so.

It is easy for him to make a call just by saying, ""Alexa call dad""  He has also learned to ask Alexa to play music.  The other features are not appropriate for him but the ability to make video calls is worth the money.  If I had a wish list it would include making the screen more moveable.

It has the potential to be really good!","March 2, 2018","I've been pleased with this purchase. It's nice to get the weather and traffic updates every morning. We control lights through our Philips Hue. We've used the Alexa app to make video calls. Music of course. The sound is acceptable. Certainly, our very old but high end stereo system is better, but this is convenient for use while in the kitchen, where it is located. Finding times for movies and where they are playing locally is more convenient than using the phone or PC. Other such simple queries are equally convenient.

However, making more complex queries through Alexa are the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. It's not as reliable a source of information as a Google search on our phone or computer. Amazon needs to keep working on Alexa so it can respond more accurately to natural speech requests. Looking forward to improvements in that area over time.

Finally, most Alexa skills seem to be, of course, designed to work with Echo devices without a screen. There needs to be more skills developed to take advantage of the screen. For example, I am unaware of a good map skill that works in the same way as Google maps or even Apple maps does on a phone or tablet. Seems like a natural. Again, hoping to see improvements to this platform in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_188?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=188&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Echo Show is easier to set up than the original, which is important, because there is very little documentation contained in the nicely designed packaging.  Amazon has successfully marketed this innovative product, and it does what it is supposed to, and does it well.  Consequently, there is little need to evaluate the features that were advertised.  Instead, I will report on some of what is problematic, in my opinion.

Despite the 7"" display, the Echo Show is primarily an audio device.  The screen is tiny compared with anything but a cell phone, and therefore watching a program beyond a few minutes is a bit of a chore.  The speakers are stereo, yet they somehow sound less full than the mono speakers on the original Echo.  I contacted Amazon to ask how to adjust the band equalizer, and the tech rep told me there was none.  Only volume control is possible, at present.  In that regard, the Show is an unfinished product and hopefully some kind of tone control will be forthcoming soon.

The Drop-In feature also seems unfinished to me.  There does not appear to be a method for deleting contacts, which means people on your lists may be able to monitor conversations without much notice.  In my judgement, this represents a serious privacy issue, so be aware that after the initial (and subtle) tones, you may not know that someone is drop-in listening to your Show unit from afar.

As a purchasing platform for Amazon, the Show is well-developed, as buying products is (perhaps too) easy.  I imagine that Amazon will be refunding many thousands of of items ordered by accident or by unauthorized customers.

I think that Amazon owes its customers a bit of an apology for releasing a product that is not quite ready for prime (pun very much intended) time.  The Show needs a better screen, real audio controls, improved (or some) documentation and a lower price to live up to the hype.

Amazon is one of the world's foremost pioneers in technology products.  In my judgement, it has the resources to do better and I expect that it will.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_440?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=440&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Customizing the screen is it's worst feature. I am scared to turn on the calling feature also as apparently all my echo devices will ring no matter who phones me. A major breach of security. There seems to be no way to allow only certain callers in your phones contact list to be permitted... it's all or none!

Here's why in detail:

1) The bright touch screen makes the human-machine communication easier than with an audio-only black box (correction: black cylinder). A quick glance at the Echo Show yields a picture of the artist, lyrics, album art, the weather, or wikipedia info. That picture is worth more than a thousand words. That is obviously exaggerated: the true extra value of the screen is probably a dozen words spoken by Alexa's synthetic voice. Still, that is better.

2) The main advantage of the screen is to enhance the existing Echo experience. The new capabilities of the touch screen are also pretty cool. Saying ""Alexa play youtube Stephen Colbert"" is faster than grabbing a smartphone out of the pocket, followed by some frantic fingering. Echo show is great for short interactions such as news events. It's also possible to watch Amazon prime video, but such longer engagements on a small screen are not the sweet spot. This is Echo Show, not Echo TV.

3) It is my impression that the sound quality is a bit better than the conventional Echo. The new Echo Show has 2 front facing speakers that project true stereo sound. The original Echo is mono.

4) The Echo Show screen adds colorful eye candy to the kitchen counter. Music is shows wit album art. A nice touch is that the screen dims dark when nobody is in sight. It immediately wakes up as soon as some movement is in its field of view.

5) The video call capability is great for setting up a connection with elderly parents. Echo Show is easier to operate than a smartphone and the camera is always in the right upright position. I was pleasantly surprised that it is possible to call the Echo dot in my daughter's room, even though it is on the same account. The system is very easy to setup and convenient to use.

After all these positive points, I have to mention one weaker issue of the Echo Show. The original Echo is an industrial design masterpiece: an iconic cylinder made from excellent materials. It will end up in art musea next to iconic Apple and Braun designs. The teardown at iFixit shows that this beauty runs more than skin-deep, with elegant engineering of the inner components. The Echo Show is not at that level. It is not even close with its utilitarian square design and cheaper looking plastic. It looks like any $30 clock radio at first glance. That is a missed opportunity, because the Show will have to be placed in a prominent place in kitchens or the living room.

Overall, the Echo Show is a good functional improvement over the orginal Echo. It is a product that is ahead of any competition, while still at a reasonable price point. Kudos for Amazon in pulling this off so well. Echo is a device that Apple should have brought to market, but wasn't able to without Steve Jobs. Jeff Bezos turns out to be a worthy successor of Steve's spirit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wish there was a specific mode or some options that would be for this type of customer. I have a google calendar linked to show her specifics that are happening on certain days, kids’ birthdays, etc. But on days with more than one event, rather than the home screen scrolling through each event of the particular day, it shows the first event and then will say ( plus 2 other events).  There is no way she will ever know how to check for the “other 2 events”. I teach her and she forgets within a minute.

I also wish there was a scrolling reminder option where you could type certain messages and they would display as well: “Remember to leave Alexa ON ALL OF THE TIME” or “Remember: You must say ‘ALEXA’ first in order for her to listen to your command”.  Or even things like: “Your son has someone coming to fix your roof next week”.  This repetitive communication is essential and will help these older, suffering adults maintain their dignity and be able to live on their own in their own home for a much longer period of time.

The idea of this is amazing. If a software designer would focus a bit through this lense I present I know this would be the next cool “Apple” product.  Think in terms of allowing a grown child to effectively communicate and stay connected with an aging parent while saving them some of the exhausting time it can take.  My mom loves to help and be a part but telling her she is supposed to make her famous pecan pie for Thanksgiving, and not green bean casserole, and having to tell her truly over 50 Times is degrading.

This is a great start- it seems like a terrific product with great potential.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_81?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=81&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tend to be an electronics junkie","July 26, 2017","I've had my Echo Show for about 2 weeks now, and I really enjoy it. I tend to be an electronics junkie, and when I heard a new Echo was coming out, I had to have it! The sound quality is good and the video screen is a welcome addition. Much as I like it, however, we still haven't hooked up any smart devices that use video nor do we have relatives with an Echo Show to make video calls. This is an excellent product, but I would say that if you intend to use it mostly for music and other move conventional uses, the Show isn't really necessary. There a number of suggested videos that are fun to watch, but an upgrade wasn't really necessary for me. However, my wife has already made plans for me to hook up a front door camera and other things. So I am sure we will get full use out of the new Echo eventually.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_93?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=93&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, I'll use them anyway. Let me explain my disappointments:

1. No Netflix: I own two Kindle tablets. I sorta assumed that the echo show was going to be able to do at least what my Kindle does. However, it doesn't even do that. I was shocked when my Echo Show told me it could not SHOW me Netflix. While I am an avid prime user, my wife loves to watch Grey's Anatomy while she cooks and does the dishes. When I cook and do the dishes, I tend to watch Sopranos and Dick Van Dyke (on prime), but since my wife is mainly a Netflix user, this is a point of contention. AGAIN, let me stress, one should assume that the more expensive Show can AT LEAST do what my cheap kindle cand do.

2. No Youtube: I love watching random videos, concerts, cooking instruction, and everything in between. Moreover, I mainly do this on my CHEAP KINDLE TABLET, so AGAIN I assumed The Echo Show would SHOW me Youtube. It does not.

3. Viewing angle: The viewing angle is not that great, especially since compared to my CHEAP KINDLE TABLET. The screen also bleeds some light.

I could get over #3 if Amazon fixed the Netflix and Youtube issue. I own two echo dots an echo plus, so I was super excited to purchase this. I am astounded that Amazon would release this without having Netflix and Youtube, not to mention Hulu. Amazon, if you're reading this, please tell us if and when these apps come available. In the meantime, I'm shipping this back.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Well no problem with Amazon products, original Echo & Show from California, Dots from the UK, 4K Fire TV from Germany, Dash Wand from Sweden, all working just fine thank you.

Of course not all the skills work such as Uber, Amazon Shopping Basket for groceries, etc, but all the main skills are up & running.
The new show is a constant source of wonderment for anyone who sees it.
Even when I'm not interacting with it, she is showing the weather, time, great background pictures, news stories and various tips on what to ask her.
I think the best feature of the Show (and all the Echo series) is that fact that the Alexa platform is constantly evolving so she is literally getting smarter as each day goes by.

In a typical day, I'll ask her for my news briefing which is customized just for me (no sports, thanks!), be informed of the local weather, play some of my favourite tracks from Spotify, arm my Arlo security cameras and answer a myriad of questions I may have about almost anything under the sun.

The phrase ""Digital Assistant"" is used quite a lot to describe Alexa products but it's so much more than that.
Just the way I can take my phone out of my pocket and check my shopping list that compiled for me from either voice memos or by the Wand saves me so much time, I literally save a small fortune by not using sticky notes all over the place :-)

I put a Dot in my Prius Prime and connected it via my phone's WiFi hotspot and audio out to the aux in and I have a voice activated computer to rival any car on the market, the sound quality is just great.

But back to the Echo Show - if you are wondering whether you should pull the trigger and buy one the smart answer is YES!
It'll probably be the most useful purchase you make this year.
I'm looking forward to when I can ask Alexa to show me the video feeds from my security system or drop in to other Show users for a video chat.
All of which are working just fine in the US but not yet rolled out in Europe.
But it's only a matter of time . . . .

UPDATE JULY 2018: Now the videochat drop-in function works here in Europe and so does the videofeed from my Ring 2 doorbell system!

ALEXA: Turn the lights off, lock the doors and play David Bowie from Spotify . . . . . . . . OK!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love that this can stream the videos from here. I found this works good most of the time.

I have trouble with trying to stream The Flintstones, and I have all of the seasons of them. I have a kitten that loves that show and need her to be occupied while I need to sleep. I do not have trouble with any other shows that I watch on this.

I have used this as an alarm and it works pretty good. I have also used the timer on this when I have gone it to lay down, and dinner is in the oven.

It is handy to see what the time is and asking for the temps is nice just before climbing out of bed (helps me know what to wear to work).

I have mine on a power strip and turn it off when I leave for the day ( I have almost everything on a power strip and use the toggle switch to turn them off when not using). This does not take up much room and is handy for my small space.

One feature that they took away is you tube, and that was nice when it did work, not a deal breaker for me. I am not sure how long this will work, but for now it is nice. The drop in feature I am having trouble with, and wish that it worked, to check up on my house when I am gone.  I got that to work once and then not again. That is the one thing I wish that I could get to work, and for me and that reason only I would not purchase again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have 6+ Alexa devices and this one is the most expensive and no more functional than an inexpensive echo. The sad part is that Amazon doesn't leverage the screen much. The Show unit just flips random pop culture and news story leads all day and tries to convince you to ask Alexa about them. There is no way to curate the news items. On my Android phone I can choose what I get alerts about - on the Show, Amazon chooses the stories and most of the items are sort of inane. In a world where personalization is 20 years old it would seem to be table stakes to be able to choose alerts from a publication that you subscribe to and a category of RSS feeds like U.S Politics or Automotive - to tailor it to my interests instead of Amazon's. Also the fact you need another device like a computer or cell phone with the Alexa app to add and manage skills - especially when the Show has a 7"" screen - is silly. You can customize everything about an iPad mini on the same size screen. Amazon - improve the software or this device is a goner.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Great device. Very helpful for those with disabilities.","August 15, 2018","It's very entertaining. One you understand how to phrase a command or question. It's perfect.

I'm disabled so it helps me out with lights. I can listen to radio, watch Amazon Prime movies.

It keeps your mind sharp with apps. Helps with words you are unsure about spelling. The same with complicated math I no longer have the brain power to manage.

I can call who ever is on my phone list, hands free. That is superior for someone who has difficulty using their hands.

It's an easy set up. I've had mine for about three months. I'm still learning so much about it.

You can ask to listen to full albums if you have Amazon Prime music. It shows everything available. You can say scroll and it will go to the next set of selections.

You can tell the Show which one by name or tell it the number that is listed under your selection. It's that easy.

It has videos to help you sleep. Ocean waves, babbling brooks, forrest streams. It's also a great app.

Setting an alarm clock, you can also add the song you want to wake up to from Amazon Prime Music. It also has normal alarm clock ""buzzer"" sounds.

Intercom. This helps me call the other Alexa when my husband is in the other room and can't hear me.

Lists for Groceries, to do lists. Reminder Lists.

I think I've just scratched the surface of all the things it can do.

It's a helpful tool for everyone, but I can't stress enough how helpful it is for people with disabilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However things went downhill quickly when it came to what to show on the screen as it sits untouched on my desk. In absence of a good clock or other useful display I opted for photos from my Prime album. Two problems became apparent:

- First is the incredibly annoying 'Try...' hints text, it seems there is no way to switch this off. I now have 'Try ""Alexa, give me a Star Wars fact"", which is extraordinary. Despite having paid for the Echo Show I have to put up with hints I do not want. Now after some time I see the screen has gone into a screen saver mode just showing the time.

- Second issue is I have been trying to show the photos from Prime Album, the photos don't change no matter what setting I choose.

So I am stuck with the time, the weather, a stupid message and the same photo or the time, not an attractive digital clock, just the time. Oddly the Echo Spot seems more developed, at least I can have a choice of analog clock face so I fail to see the benefit of the Echo Show, by comparison I might as well stick with an Echo Dot. Maybe Amazon will correct this in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There were 4 ...","July 26, 2018","Five stars!!!!! There were 4 Echo dots in my house but now 2 are retired and replaced by the Echo Show. Just my wife and I live in our home and I spend a lot of my time in my home studio that is not connected to the main house. The show gives us the ability to communicate by drop in with out having to walk back and forth between the two structures. Being a musician and someone who listens to music constantly I find the music anywhere function a plus. Having prime music gives the ability to play songs or groups at will and on any or all devices at once. Being able to voice control the volume per individual device is a big plus. Will eventually up grade all dots to shows. However I really wish Amazon would make it so the user can select and name each device what ever the user desires. Not liking the limited option for device names. Most definitely don't want to wake with the name (Amazon).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_90?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=90&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The speakers sound much better than I anticipated. I think most folks will struggle to find a handy, comprehensive list of commands. There are far too many reference sources that offer a bunch of nonsensical suggestions. Thus far; I'm enjoying the ability to use Show for music, as a security monitor when I'm away from home and as a source of information. If you're thoroughly invested in Amazon services (as I am), you'll find a much greater use for this product. I particularly like the rotating feed of news headlines. Thankfully; they consist of more than the usual political stupidity. I've viewed some YouTube videos, sampled off beat new stories and tested the ability to scan product barcodes. I do have a want list (as I do with most any product): stopwatch functionality (different from timers), heat index readings when requesting current weather conditions, the ability to identify unknown songs playing from other sources (movies on TV).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews"

She has a difficult time hearing me on my iphone or my husband's Samsung phone.  The speakers in the Echo Show are terrific.  She is able to hear me very well.  When we bought this, we didn't realize how useful the calling would be, not only to my own mother, but to friends, clinics and businesses where you reach a real person.  It looks like we can get her one also, and she wouldn't need to have a cell phone. What I don't know is how she can request it to dial us without a cell phone but rather using the Alexa directory.  (something to research further.)  She also has difficulty playing music on a boom box, but could possible just ask Alexa to play what she wanted to hear.  She does have an internet connection in her independent living condo.  We are currently in Arizona for 3 months, and our cell service drops calls repeatedly making it doubly hard to communicate with her.

I love Alexa and Amazon. Have been a member since 2011 and have had my eye on the echo show since it came out.

What really appealed to me as a newlywed married to a fireman was that this device when paired with a smart camera can show me my front door or future child’s nursery when my husband is away on a 24 or 48 hour shift.

The screen is large and sleek. Alex is so versatile with what she can do on the show. When playing music The lyrics play at the same time making it great to sing along.

I am so beyond impressed with this show that I plan to buy a second one. To use one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom. It is truly better then I expected it could be.

As a future mother, this device removes the need for an expensive baby monitoring system that can only do one thing- monitor.

The only thing is I need to get an echo so I don’t have to shout from the bedroom. I will say that it hasn’t been uneventful using it (first used my son’s prime account and wound up turning his lights off). I still have a lot to learn on it but it is great. I want to hook my TV up to it for example. I can turn on and off lamps and my coffeemaker. My plan is, when able, my house will be like the Starship Enterprise, if only they had an app to open doors.

It took some effort to set up an amazon account for her and go through the set up for Alexa Calling (since she does not have a cellphone) but the effort was well worth it. She has no idea how this thing works, or where it came from, but she is always thrilled to see my face on the screen. I chat with her using the Alexa app on my phone every day after work.

I got the show for the kitchen to try out the video aspect (and the ability to display recipes) ... which was not nearly as good as I had hoped.  First ... it doesn't actually display MY recipes and I was not able to figure out a way to ""favorite"" a recipe to make it easier to find it on the future.  This could have been a great appliance ... but it fell far short of what I wanted.  I was willing to wait to see if this might change in the future; however, the device video display started to show jagged lines on the screen that the recommended troubleshooting steps only resolved temporarily (like a few minutes to maybe an hour).  Send back to Amazon for exchange/repair (no longer able to actually just return it ... which I would for just a plain echo device without the video).

Alexa is used as an alarm and I enjoy having lyrics of songs displayed on the screen. Video calling is a plus as well. The previous words were my review approximately one week after opening the box and setting it up. This is no longer the case, for the last two months I've tried everything available to resolve a glitching screen and audio quality issues. I'm at the end of my patience and my options. I've spent $300 for something that doesn't function as intended on any level. This is apparently a known issue with first gen Echo Show's and they're still selling them. Please pay close attention to what you are actually ordering. I have not had any satisfaction in getting a resolution even though I purchased the protection plan for both Echo Show's in my house. Yes both have the same horrid issues. I don't know what else to say except, buyer beware.  I'm saddened as my Echo Spot and Echo Dots work spectacularly. I had more confidence in Amazon's customer relations, and even hoped that the fact I've been a Prime Amazon customer since day one.

Flanagan","Not ready for prime time","December 22, 2017","I received the Echo Show as an early Christmas gift, after having considered buying it for myself when it came out this past fall. I had decided against buying, because it didn't appear to add much to my already existing lineup of first-generation Echo and a sixpack of Echo Dots that are connected to various speaker systems. As it turns out, I was right, and I wasn't even considering the loss of YouTube, at the time. Now it's really not ready.

The Show is tailor-made for the kitchen, so I replaced the Echo with the device. I had not checked recipe/cooking skills in a significant amount of time. I was very disappointed to see the lineup of skills. There is not a single reputable, highly rated, all around recipe/cooking skill anywhere to be found. There is no way to simply call up a recipe for a meal. If third-party skill makers haven't done it, Amazon needs to step up themselves.

As far as the screen goes, the loss of YouTube is devastating to its usefulness. But, Amazon has only themselves to blame, as they have been crowding out other device makers. First Apple, then Google could not get their products on Amazon. And now, Amazon is removing Nest products in their tit-for-tat with Google. We are all the losers. But, I thought there would at least be something I could do to get the damn commercials/suggestions from constantly scrolling. A nice photomontage of vacation pictures and videos I thought.

But then I found out I couldn't do anything to control the montage. No ability to set the timing, no ability to set effects (fade, etc.) and no way to add music. These are basic that should have been part of this device from the very beginning.

I wouldn't have bought this myself, but as a gift, I am hoping that Amazon will get their act together, both with Google, and with some built-in skills. I guess until then all we'll have is lyrics to whatever music we' re listening to.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I mean, who wouldn't like an assistant that doesn't talk back.  I have the original Alexa, the Tap and the Show.  Alexa often stops playing music in the middle of the song.  What makes me more mad is that Amazon is coming out with a brand new Alexa only 2 months and 5 days after I ordered, not one but two (one was a gift) Alexa Shows.  Now I feel like mine is outdated and I want the new one but refuse to purchase one at this point.  I wish I had known and I would have waited for the new & improved Alexa Show.  Hate to say that I'm disappointed.

 You will notice that the Show is aware when you enter the room, and lights up. That was kinda creepy when I first realized what was going on. It can take pictures if asked. It's fun watching it learn, and reading about the updates.
 I bought the stand for it, which is VERY helpful and quite good looking.
 All in all, if you are happy with the Amazon family of products, you will love the Show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_117?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=117&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Echo lineup far surpasses everything else out there. I gave the “Show” products only 4 stars because they are not at the top of their game yet. Every month new “skills” are added making the Show more useful than the previous month.

Some people on here are giving poor reviews because of the YouTube situation. That is not the fault of Amazon. Google has a competing smart speaker without a video screen at this time so they’re not interested promoting the Echo competition.
YouTube videos are currently available on iPads, tablets, smartphones, PCs, Macs, Roku, Apple TV, Smart TVs, etc, etc! Isn’t that enough?

I use the 4 Echo unit’s to control my Vera Plus home automation + countless other functions including SiriusXM, Pandora and now specific radio stations located all over the country are being added as new “skills” every month. The Echo lineup of products will be THE table radio of the future and the future is now.

One could say this is to be expected ...","December 14, 2017","The Show is exactly what 3 stars represents.. Just Okay.  I have several alexa products around the house, and was excited about the show, but it just isn't worth the cost.  As of the time of this writing, the cost is down around $150 vs the $225 paid for a preorder, so there is some more value at the lower price.

There are two main issues with the the show, which are huge for a product that is made to excel in these areas..

Firstly, the microphones to pick up voice commands are garbage.  One could say this is to be expected since it's front facing and not round like an Echo.  I find this to be a huge issue.  You have to be directly facing the show for it to listen to commands.  My 1st gen Echo, which is now named an Echo Plus, can hear my voice commands better and it's in the other room from where the Show is located.  Disappointing to say the least.

Secondly, the speaker is just OK.  Sound quality is not anywhere near the 1st gen Echo (now named Echo Plus).  This may be because it was engineered more for voice calling, but  the speaker should not be this bad of quality for the price.

There are a few other things that need improvement, like screen commands, but assume they will be addressed with updates in the future.

Overall, disappointed with the Show having paid the preorder price of $225 (or thereabouts) per unit.  At $150 it's a more considerable deal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The echo show and tv screen is always on unless you tell it "" Alexa do not disturbe me"" it will than go to sleep..... still working but the tv screen will be off.  I think it will get better in time. Now I have 25 smart plugs and Echo does a great job turning on and off the lights.

Surely, after all this time, the IT departments at Amazon and Ring.com would have corrected issues like the inability to two-way communicate with someone at the door, blurred video, the SLOW connection times and the lack of a way to be advised of someone within camera range. Nope! I just bought the Alexa Show in February, 2018 and there has been no improvements. Ring.com's last help info article is dated July, 2017 so I can tell I have wasted my money on the Alexa Show as no improvements have been made in over 6 months. What a waste of a potentially great opportunity!

UPDATE: After trying for two days I have given up on the Echo Show, am returning it, and buying another tablet to keep in the den so as to have access to the Ring.com cameras. I also discovered there is no way to control the floodlights so IF you get the cameras up live there is no way to manually turn on the floodlights. Really disappointed as I had high hopes for the Echo Show.

When I purchased I bought two one for my girlfriend and one for myself.  Being that she lives in another state about a two and a half hour drive away, we have really made use of the Echo Shows.  The video quality of these device when doing video calls is nothing short of awesome.  I recently took a 10 day business trip to Thailand and used the Alexa app to make video calls from my phone to her Echo Show and the video quality was incredible.  Out of about 30 video calls only once did we have an issue outside of that the video and quality was superb.  Also, being able to lookup play and view Youtube videos is fast and efficient.  Lastly, the fact that it also shows the lyrics to a majority of the songs that you search for can not be overlooked.  Now, for my request to make this device better: 1. It would be nice if it came with a stand that would swivel so you did not have to pick it up and turn it like when I move from the dining room table to the kitchen if I were able to just twist it that would be more convenient.  2. If the device was able to be adjusted up or down to change the camera view because having to stand in front of it and lean over to be viewed is not very user friendly.

I've only had it a couple days now, but so far so good! We have been able to use it for watch movies  and TV on Amazon video,  listened to music on Pandora, used video chat (w/ show & cellphone), made a shopping list, set multiple timers at once,  viewed recipes w/ all recipe, checked the weather, used the calendar ...
The show has louder speakers than the dot. But dot has better range for listening to commands. I takes a while to get down the  Specific commands, but once you do it's great to have hands free.
I will be pairing this with a cloud camera ""grandma""  got to help keep an eye on the little ones. (I will update when I use)
It would be nice to have more video and news (other than flash news) options like Flip Board, BBC News, HuffPost, Netflix or hulu.

I had some weird problems with this when I first got it and gave it 2 stars. When I asked it recipes it said it was showing them but it showed nothing. When I asked it a mathematical question like ""What is 3 times 5?"" it showed the equation 3 * 5 = 15 but the 15 was superimposed on the equation, making it unreadable. When I asked for a map of the US it said ""Showing your location"" but showed nothing, so it both answered the wrong question and did not actually show anything. Well, I considered returning it but I got it on a Prime Day for about 40% off, so I decided to see if the problems would be fixed before returning it. I am glad I did. Within a week or so the first two problems were fixed. The third remains. I assume that they discovered the problems and fixed them in an upgrade. That is one thing I like about the Alexa devices.

I subscribe to Amazon Music.  Just asking it to play say, Beethoven Piano Trios, will give you random piano trios.  How does it miss the word Beethoven?  I will probably keep it for a while to master it as I think old people like them, and I like the idea of using it for video conferencing. But, if I didn't get it for half off on Amazon Prime Day, I would be unhappy.  Also, as others have noticed, it's seemingly impossible to get it to show recipes.

But there are improvements to be made...","July 6, 2018","This is our 2nd Echo device but the first with a screen and we love it. The sound quality is better than the original Echo but the microphones may not be quite as good / sensitive. Seems like we have to speak up a bit more when far away (compared to old Echo). But that's not really an issue or complaint, just an observation.

The screen is part fun, part useful, and part gimmick. Phone calls are neat but it's just Skype and the other part needs an Echo Show (etc) for video calling to work.

What it lacks? Simple, add video calling apps like Skype and Google Hangouts (yea, not Amazon's call to make). It also needs YouTube and Netflix right on the device. You probably wouldn't use these features much but it's silly not to have them (yes, I know, not Amazon's call to make again). Regardless, figure it out Amazon!

It controls Fire TV just like the old Echo. I think I read a review where somebody said differently but it works fine as long as you say the name of your device. We used to say ""Alexa, pause"" while a Netflix show was running on Fire TV but now we have to say ""Alexa, pause Fire TV"" and it works fine.

If you want an Echo then this is the one to get for sure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Looking past the obvious problems like no Youtube there are such egregious UX/UI problems that I really feel their entire product team should be replaced.  Standard things like connecting to a bluetooth speaker are so far looking impossible.
OK I thought I'll use it for Skype calls. Someone explain how that's possible. :-)
Fine let me just hook up my calendars I thought, but you can only hook up one Google account and I have 5.
And on and on.

There really is no excuse for a company like Amazon to produce something this pathetic with such obvious shortcomings.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I pre-ordered 2 of them, and have been using since day 1. I mainly use it to talk to my grandmother. Video chat between two Echo Shows is great. My grandmother finally has a piece of tech that she can't get wrong. She can control it all with just her voice. I also use it as an alarm clock. The sound quality from the speakers is great for it's size. At night I like to search relaxing white noise or meditation music, esp on YouTube, and fall asleep to it. Sometimes I ask Alexa the weather. I also use the voice call functionality. I don't use all the features of the Show, but the limited array of core features that I do use, they're fantastic and have enabled me to get in touch even easier with family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_77?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=77&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I neither love it nor hate it, it is meh, underwhelming. I replaced the Echo original on my desk with the Echo Show, and while it is cool to see the weather displayed when I glance over, there is a very notable, annoying lag in Alexa's response time. The speakers seem inferior in sound quality to that of my original Echo, which is quite disappointing. They also may be the reason Alexa sounds more robotic compared to the originals more pleasing sound. At this point I am considering bringing my original Echo back on my desk, I like her better.

I received an Echo Show for Christmas and I’m really trying to make it useful. I can do everything the Echo does with my iphone and some of it a lot easier. One simple task I would like to do is to play audio files from my network hard drive to the Echo. I know I can connect via Bluetooth but then I can’t use the Bluetooth speaker to have the audio in multiple rooms.

I looked into the Amazon Music Unlimited but uploading to that is no longer supported. There are no inputs on the Echo show so that is not an option. The only way I can see doing it at this time is to add a minimum of two more Echo products to my home and before I do that I need to figure out if it is going to improve my situation at all.

I already have a Control 4 system in my home so the smart home part is taken care of. I can integrate Alexa into that but I would still need more Echo devices around the house for true voice control.

Are there any plans to make audio streaming more user friendly and accessible? Will there be any better home network integration? Will I be able to integrate my existing network cameras?

It would also be nice if I could have it show pictures from my network drive instead of having to load them up to the Amazon Photo Storage when I want to make changes.

I like the concept of the Echo but I don’t know if I can make it useful.

Hopefully there will be some major improvements in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_54?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=54&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1 - Got the Ring doorbell.  It will show, but there is a few second delay.  Reasonable and not a big issue, but an issue.

2 - Got a EZVIZ camera. You have to link it, but will not show up. Alexa says she is getting camera, but it never shows. No answer from EZVIZ. Camera works fine on my iphone.

3 - Drop in/calling.  Camera is worthless for seeing anything in the room.  It shows picture of celling.  If someone were standing directly in front of it, that would work.

I really love seeing them when I talk to them. Mom is in a nursing home and very hard of hearing. Conversations on the phone of gotten shorter lately because she understands only about half of what I say. The Echo Show is loud enough and because she can see me, she can read lips a bit. The quality of our interaction has gone up immensely. My dad lives 8 Miles Away from her and depending on the weather can't visit her all the time. Giving him another way to stay connected.  So 5 stars for that!
Now for the downside. There's some weird configuration problems. My two brothers and sisters purchased one after I got them. They are having difficulty specifying which of my echo shows to call. three are on my Prime account. My siblings have their own Prime accounts. Although I've named each show differently, they never can tell who's going to answer when they try to call my mom my dad or myself. It's all tied into the contact list on my phone (and theirs) in some weird way. If they can fix this at least another star or two. I also really wish they would settle things with YouTube.

However, I just discovered a major flaw.  I retired my alarm clock and started using my amazing Echo Show for my morning alarm instead.  But, what I discovered this morning is that there is no battery backup.  We lost power last night and this morning my Echo Show was about 3 hours behind, causing us to oversleep.  Our internet connection devices (modem and router) are on a power strip that had to be reset.  Once we reset it the time updated on the Echo Show.  That would indicate that it must be connected to the internet for all clock and alarm functions to be correct.  I've learned my lesson - I guess I'll have to use my alarm on my phone as a backup.  This can't be counted on as being reliable.  It's too bad because otherwise it is an amazing device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Much better than our plain Echos.","July 21, 2018","Honestly we are long term owners of Echo devices, yet we were very reticent to buy the echo show and now we are happy that we did.

The speakers are loud, more like the big Echo than the Dot.

The prompting on the screen for things to try is opening our eyes to new ways to use Alexa. You just don't have that without a screen.

We have elderly grandparents that have found the Echo Show (yes, we bought them one as well) easy to use for video calls.  They were flumuxed by the Apple iDevices we got them.

Like most, we pit it in our kitchen -- on the table for us.

Using recipes is much easier than on the tablet that goes dark all the time to save battery.

It is superior to our Kindle HD8s in show mode.  The camera is wider angle so we aren't having to croud together during calls, the camera does not smear and jitter, the mic on the Show is very good and they do a great job of canceling the noise they are making for you to speak.

Would I like a 8 or 10 inch screen, yes. Would I like Google to quit being monopolitive jerks and quit singling out the echo to block from you tube?  Yes. Google used to be a champion of consumer freedom, now that tHey are on top, they are hurting our choices.

We have a Google speaker, too, ane we are sticking with Amazon Echos because we don't like being bullied.

Seriously, off our rant on Google, we highly recommend the show.

If you are a DIYer like us, we've written Alexa home automation stuff for our homemade sensors, too.  It is a well done platform.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just like any other Alexa but with one extremely irritating feature!","August 16, 2018","So I had two Echo devices already but purchased this Echo Show for a number of reasons. I thought having pictures of my kids, extended family, and places that I've visited all displayed on the screen would be nice. Also I can make calls and it has an interactive clock that shows the weather too. Great!

However it has one extremely irritating 'feature'. You cannot turn off the 'Try this..."" tips from the screen. I'm a 51 year old man and quite tech savvy. I don't want constant scrolling messages about ""Try, Alexa, tell me a horse joke"" or ""Try, Alexa, how do I play music around my house' and so on. No break, just random stupid messages that ruin the photograph you want to display.

These devices so far have been great and you quickly get accustomed to what is useful to you. Playing music, listening to Audible, turning the house lights on/off, controlling my Sonos system but I'd avoid this one. It's now in my bedroom and frankly - I should have saved my money and purchased another Dot.

It gets worse! The latest software update has reduced the size of the nighttime clock dramatically. This makes it useless for anyone that like me wears glasses.

I know this version has been replaced with a new model with a bigger screen - possibly the reason, but I’m not buying another one.

This goes in the cupboard as I have other Echo devices but for my bedroom I’m back to a regular clock.

Thanks Amazon. Feeling let down.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There was some concerns about privacy and all the issues but I wanted to try it out to help manage the numerous smart devices we have rather than managing each via their app.  Alexa has since been approved and we used the dot for a few things.  Then the Show went on sale for $129 and seemed like the perfect compliment.  We added the Show and haven't been disappointed since.  It sits on our kitchen bar so we can access it from multiple rooms.  Our boys will just come down and watch cartoons on it or play some Weird Al.  It also connects seamlessly with our Bose surround sound in the family room.  It now controls everything from the garage door to the temperature of the house.  It is very convenient to use and the drop in feature works great.  We have so many people now wanting to add a Show to their home, especially during parties where music is playing and they see the lyrics scrolling through.

We decided on the Alexa Show as it would be visible as well as verbal.  The calling and drop in feature was an added bonus.  We were so impressed with the video calls, that she purchased one for each of her siblings.  They can all call their mother and see her when unable to visit.  The grandkids call and it has worked out very well.  Her mother can easily make calls with just her voice.  What a great tool.  However, it took some time to figure out how to set up her mother's device as she does not have a cell phone.  Customer Service said no way to set it up without one.  After much thought I found a work around.  I was able to download an app on my iphone to get a second number - free - on my phone and use it to set up her mother's device.  The number is only assigned to the show and never rings on my phone.  Worked perfectly.  Amazon, this is such a great device for aging parents and they don't all have cell phones, so either fix the setup or document a work around as I found and not just say it won't work.  My friend almost returned all of the devices she purchased when we hit this snag.  There are ways to make it work, train your Customer service team.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The longer I own this, the less I like it. I would have been better off buying a new Alexa-enabled Kindle Fire HD and a decent Bluetooth speaker, because it still doesn't support Netflix or Hulu and it now fails to show me my or Prime watchlist, saying that it's empty when it's not.  To top it all off, it won't even connect, via Bluetooth, to my new Kindle Fire HD. It still connects just fine to my old one, but not the new one?  It's bad enough that I should even have to consider connecting them because Amazon neglected to add support for other video streaming services, but now I can't even rig the system like I used to?  That's completely unacceptable and  I'm deducting another star for it!  I just wish that it was still within my return window so I could send it back.  It basically just takes up room on my kitchen counter while I use my Kindle and headphones these days.  At least an Echo Spot would have looked better in that role.

If you want any more details from a more optimistic (but still dissatisfied) me,  my old review is below:

The screen is identical to a Kindle, and the sound quaility is very good, but not as good as the Gen 1 Echo, IMO.  I love the ability to look things up and get visual feedback, as well as using the touchscreen for those times when voice control is either inconvenient or impossible.

This would be a 5 star review, if for only a few things:

First and foremost, it needs to support Netflix , Hulu, and YouTube, but it doesn't.  Even just one of those services would be a saving grace because, let's face it, man cannot live by Prime Video alone.  You can ask it to show you videos of [insert subject here],  and it will search on Vimeo, (which means you'll usually get music videos) but it doesn't have access to your account and playlists.

I also wish that it could adjust the screen brightness with a voice command, rather than using the touchscreen.  You can turn the screen completely off via voice, but mine seems to turn back on by itself within a few minutes anyway.  If a future update fixes these flaws, I'll change my review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_431?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=431&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When you see other products that say, ""works with Alexa,"" that doesn't necessarily mean you just plug it in.  A lot of devices require other devices.. and not all devices play well together.

An example.. Phillips Hue bulb ""works with Alexa."" But no.. this bulb does not. This bulb works with a Phillips hue bridge hub.. and that hub most likely works with Alexa. As is the case with ""Wink Relay"" switches. They all work with Alexa.. but they don't. The switches work with the Wink Hub.. which in turn may work with Alexa.

All these device manufacturers.. they share one commonality, and that is the urge for exclusivity. In all reality.. if you truly want an ""all out"" automated home, there is no way around purchasing individual ""hubs"" for each and every different brand of device. You will have a closet with hubs on top of hubs.. all required to communicate with Alexa. One workaround is learning how to flash firmware with modified coding. I, personally, turned both of my ""Wink Relays"" into ""wall mounted Galaxy cell phones"" with all the apps I need. Still though.. I rarely find myself standing infront of the walls playing candy crush on the light switches.

My point is that there are options.. and the 4 stars I rate this is not because of what it does, but rather the potential it holds. Alternatively.. you also have to ask yourself which aspects of the ""home automation"" is truly necessary and start the first. You cannot just go fill a shopping cart full of random ""works with Alexa"" devices, then go plug it all in. You will drive yourself crazy.

Do your homework.. and look into brands that offer a lot of what you want. Stick to few brands that offer vast selections of devices.. then get their hubs to make the stuff work. This isn't magic.. there's a science to it and the less confusing you make things for yourself, the better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound is actually pretty good for music, too. I was skeptical because the speakers arent that big but it fills our large kitchen with good sound.

I used the echo show for a month, and it was growing on me despite some of the quirks with Alexa. I subscribed to Full Screen and it worked for one day. After that, the show would no longer play any Amazon Prime videos. After spending an hour with Amazon support and talking to 3 people, none of which were truly paying attention to what I had to say, they tell me they will contact an engineer and get back to me in 2 days.

I still think Alexa technology is very useful, but the Show does not add much. The issues as I see them are:
 - No YouTube. Seriously. It had YouTube at first which was great for checking out a quick video. Now, Google/Amazon must have had a dispute.
 - You can't do web searches, you can't install apps, you can't use the screen for controlling hue lights. The screen is there for 2 purposes: to buy from Amazon (which you can do through other devices, with descriptions) and canceling alarms quickly (only because the alarm system doesn't recognize ""Alexa, I'm skip the other alarms today.""
 - You can browse Prime Photos, but the UI is not intuevtie.
 - You can set it to do not disturb by voice, but you can't set it to turn off drop-ins.
 - Lack of video skills (most of which are flash briefings)
 - There's no multi-room streaming using Spotify.
 - It does not understand me. It gets it wrong about 50% of the time. It's far worse than the Echo.
 - You can watch prime video, but you can't cast that video to your TV or anything, so it's not a very impressive feature.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_379?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=379&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We enjoy video chatting with the kids.
Nice when cooking to ask when your hands are dirty and you are multi tasking for it to start a timer.
My 4 year old son and 1 year old nephew like yelling Alexa... so sometimes this is annoying when your 4 year old keeps asking it to Play Spider Man movie or play “Bad Boys” theme song when you just want it to be quite.
Does a morning update of what you have scheduled for the day if you like your calendar.
Will display recipes from All Recipes (I think that’s what it’s called) and a few other places.
Does a whole lot more but takes time to really learn about all that it can do.

Cons:
When you say Alexa show me kids movies you are limited on what you can see. I wish you had an easier way to feel more Movie options and recipes.
She will respond to commercials and here lately she has been coming on randomly when everyone is in bed or when no one said anything close to “Alexa”. Which is pretty funny bc in Q&A someone asked if it detected ghost.... (which you should go read the Q&A for this bc it’s worth it)

In the end I like what all it offers I just wish I had more options and control when I ask it to search movies or recipes.

When I first received it I was excited to set it up and use it but a thought lingered in my mind, ""What does the Show do that my Dot doesn't already?""

Even after a month I still find myself asking this question. Don't get me wrong I love the show and I use it every day, it's audio is far superior to the Dot and it has a screen (So it must be cool right?). But aside from the audio quality and the new visual aspect, what core features are in the Show that aren't included with the Dot? The answer, virtually nothing.

Let's start with what I usually use the echo show for telling time, setting alarms/reminders, integration with smart home products, music, news.
None of those features are exclusive to the show and none require visuals. Now, of course, you can do more with the show like watch videos(Very limited selection), video chat, and I'd assume there are some ""games"" only for the show. But do those extra features make the show worth nearly 4-6 times(depending on sales) what the Dot is? In my opinion no and I would instead suggest going with the Dot and buying a couple extra smart home gadgets with the money you saved.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_284?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=284&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sure it gets loud but it’s distorted. The display isn’t as touch responsive as I hoped. And it seems to have a much harder time hearing me.

It is replacing a Sony Dash that I was gifted in 2011. Seems odd to me that this product goes on sale 2 days before Sony bricked my Dash, but all well. So far the Echo show has been a hit. I normally have it on my nightstand, but last night I put it in the dining room during a dinner party and it was the hit of the party. Everyone kept asking the Echo questions and asking for jokes. (the jokes were the hit of the party). I must say that the voice recognition is excellent. This isn't tech from the early 2000's . I didn't have a single misunderstood word to the Echo. I got six years out of the Dash, and I hope to get many, many years of use out of the Echo. The instructions that come with the Echo are a joke. Pretty much say ""Plug it in, connect to the internet, download the smart phone app, and start using the Echo"" , and that's it. There is a learning curve, but I think that with the Echo's on screen hits and tips that it should be fairly easy to learn. The alarm clock sound are okay, but there are not many to choose from. I'm hoping that in the future that more alarm sound choices are added. The camera features seem to work very well. Picture quality is excellent.  The touch screen reacts to the light in the room auto dimming in low light, and the touch feature of the screen works very well. The ease of use of the ""drop in"" feature is very easy to use from the smart phone. Over time the calling features of this device should be excellent, but at this time it is hard to comment on the calling features as the unit has only been on sale for about 4 to 5 days and I don't know anyone else that has one yet. As far as I can tell, you can only call other people that have a Echo device (The Dot and up to the Show) , but not a cell or land line. I could be wrong about that , but again that goes to the lack of documentation that doesn't come in the box with the Echo Show. Many of the Echo Show's feature are tied into Amazon Prime (music and video come to mind right away) so it appears that you get much more use out of the built in features if you have a Prime account.  I haven't tried any of the home automated commands yet, because I don't have a Ring doorbell, Nest thermostat, or Hue lights (yet). Where the packaging is concerned, it was packaged very well, with no transit damage (as it should be) . The unit came out of the box wrapped in a protective film keeping the unit spotless until unwrapped by myself. same with the power plug and cord. The unit has an excellent finish and a hefty feel to it that scream quality. If there is a need in the future, I will update the review, but at this time I have to say ""Great job Amazon !!""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_185?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=185&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Bottom half of the screen has a constant message printed out with tips on how to use the echo. You are unable to make this message go away. So in the middle of your photo you have:
Try ""Alexa, Play Tom Petty""  or Try ""Alexa, play my messages"" This constant display of hints is unnecessary and totally irrelevant to me. I don't need or want the hints!

Our family keeps the Show in our open concept kitchen which allows us easy listening and communication from the living room and dining room, too.  I'm an Allrecipes subscriber and really enjoy using the recipes on Echo Show that can be activated by voice or touchscreen.  Since we also have a dot and original Echo in different rooms, the drop in feature works great as an intercom.  The one thing I wish would improve on the Echo devices is the ability to answer general knowledge questions easily.

I noticed that it started doing it more and more and more. Sometimes it would come up with a message ouh-oh something went wrong reboot. Overall it's okay but more times than not I come in and it has shut itself off so it doesn't really work the way I thought it was going to that's why I'm giving it three stars I was going to trade it in to upgrade to the new show but they're only offering very little.

This, unfortunately, does not work with Netflix, Hulu and barely works with Amazon Video. Everything must be controlled through app which is clunky at best. Very limited controlling through touch screen, which seems like you'd a no brainier, but Amazon wants you to mainly control the Echo Show with your voice so phrasing correctly is key. Luckily I bought using Amazon Points and was going to buy an echo anyway so I thought I'd take the leap with the show.

Meehan","Exc for ELDERLY in assisted living memory care nursing home old age community","November 25, 2018","I HIGHLY  recommend devices of this sort for elderly loved ones, whether in a facility or if they live at home. If your loved one cannot dial a phone anymore, he/she can tell Alexa to call you, or even to drop in on you if you choose to set it up for that.  Plus, you can call and video chat anytime.  If you want, you can also ""drop in"" on him/her anytime and chat or watch or listen in while the aides interact with her/him if he/she is in a facility or speak to the aides over the unit.  In the case of my mom, I left a unit connected at all times often with video and sound off at my end so she couldn't hear me  but I could always hear her,  and contact was just the touch of a button away, if she called out. On one occasion she fell and I had help there two minutes later. On another occasion she locked herself in the bathroom and again, I had help there in a couple minutes.  Sometimes I left the communication open, so we could just keep talking throughout the day, which was lovely for her.  On her last night conscious on the planet, I heard a commotion in her room and turned it on and there she was, staring at me, scared to death. The aides were there and spoke to me and told me what was up as they were calling 911. She said ""I can't move"" and I was able to talk to her and soothe her and tell her not to worry, I would be there by the time as the ambulance was, and would ride over with her... that this was just another glitch in her health another trip to the hospital, etc, etc.  The relief on her face was palpable as I spoke to her.  I have tears in my eyes as I write this, over a year later. I was able to get to her with the ambulance and ride over with her, and also able to call my sister who met us at the emergency room  We were both able to talk to her and soothe her some more before they gave her meds to put her to sleep... she didn't know it but her organs were failing and she was put her in a medical coma from which she never awoke. We would never have made it to the hospital on time without the Amazon echo. I would not have been able to talk to her and soothe her while she was freaking out in her room.  There are other devices that would serve the same purpose but I will always be a loyal Echo user as a result. There are rules about this type of equipment n facilities, and they vary from state to state, but I would never put a loved one in a facility that didn't allow it. Some facilities allow it even if not required to. In Florida and several other states, they are now required to allow it so don't let anyone tell you otherwise (of course that could change, there is a powerful lobby against cameras, etc).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No second thoughts what-so-ever!

Here is GREAT IDEA, TOO! - My ""friend"" in her autumn years, has limited mobility (crutches), and lives alone. What an incredible device to use as one of ""those"" - ""Alexa Call For Help or Call Bill - I've Fallen scenarios."" Not even any monthly recurring costs you'd be paying for one of ""those"" 5St** Emergency devices with a fee.. This takes the place and reasonable to purchase.

Being another ""eco system"" person, Alexa's voice recognition seems to be GREAT! It may be matched to my voice or something - there are so FEW commands that ""she"" doesn't understand what I've asked. (Unlike the other ""eco system"" I've used in the past.)

Sound is _good_ on the ""Shows"" too - whereas the DOT devices obviously a little lesser quality.

I use Alexa for controlling lights, heat, TV, door-lock (it will NOT let it ""open"" my locks - (smart thinking!)) but allows me to lock if I went to bed and forgot.

(The privacy issue folks? If you _believe_ the stories, then put the cell-phone down. - Turn your computer off (mute mic/cam) too!)

They're on sale, AGAIN, I see today. Compared to the 'other two' digital devices as of today? (you know what those are)  In my opinion Alexa crossed the finish line and WON, while the others are crawling to the starting gate!) Grab a couple - I'm happy I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_75?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=75&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The home screen photo rotation always stops - go in change photo location and it will resume for awhile and then stop again. If you use the ""slide show"" feature this gets around it, but every time you talk to Echo that slide show stops and you need to ask her to start it again. Not an issue, just annoying.

I guess Google has spoiled us.

You have to be VERY specific with your commands.  For example, if I say, ""Alexa, play Daniel Tiger"" the device will only find purchase options. But if I say, ""Alexa SHOW Daniel Tiger"" the device brings up the 3 free episodes. And recently after a search for a movie trailer I then asked to show Daniel Tiger but the device ""could not find a movie titled Daniel Tiger.""
Just today my son and I came home from errands and I nearly had a heart attack when I heard voices in my home. Daniel Tiger was playing on the Echo but we hadn't watched it in a full 24 hrs.

Also, for a while, we could successfully call Dad from our device to his app on the nights he was away for work. Suddenly he can no longer hear us when we call.

Cons: Price vs Utility
  Microphone has issues
  Sound quality not as good as 1st gen Echo
  Video call quality was not very good (needed a lot of lighting)

I have 2 first gen Echo devices and the sound quality and microphone in those is far superior to what I received in my Echo Show. Alexa will either not hear you or not understand you when talking 2 feet away. Alexa will also respond to random sounds (toys, pots clanking, etc...) or words and it can be a little freaky. I have yet to experience these issues with the Echo devices.

I bought this to try for video calls with family but was disappointed with the video quality. The camera quality was pretty low for this to be one of the ""attractions"" of the device.

The sound quality when playing music is not that great, either. I find the sound from the 1st gen Echo to be much better. Note, I am not an audiophile - but the sound just seems kind of flat. Also, the sound levels are odd. Volume 3 and Volume 4 are almost identical and the same with 5 and 6.

Bottom line - I am very disappointed.
The microphone will not hear or understand you when talking to it while also responding to random clinks, clanks, and words from the kitchen. I never had this issue with the Echos.

After separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device I've come to the conclusion that the Show still had me wanting more despite it's capabilities.

 I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, 2nd gen Echo in my home gym, a spot in my bedroom 12/21/17, and a dot at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, security cameras, surround sound, fire sticks, fire tv box, fire tablets and TVs all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with  a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.

Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen. A few people mentioned why don't you put it on your desk. I honestly don't spend much time in my study, if I am at my desk I'm already on my computer and wanted the Show where I would get the most use out of it.

This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients. Why can't I just say Alexa scroll down? Why do I have to touch the screen? Why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the Show already has a screen?

 As of now I've seen videos with CNN, Reuters, and Fox news during my flash briefings. There was a software update on 7/15/17 and now I've also seen CNBC videos. 7/19/17 I noticed today Bloomberg is now showing videos.

Personally I think 7 inches is too small to watch a movie from any fixed location unless it was maybe a foot or two from my face so take that in to consideration when determining where you might put one. *Update* Some of Prime's videos are widescreen meaning you only get to use about half of your already small 7 inch screen to watch them. I noticed this while trying to watch 13 Hours Soldiers of Benghazi while I was cooking. This is cellphone size small. *Update* 11/11/17 I noticed yesterday while cooking and watching a movie on Prime I was given an option to expand a wide screen video to full screen fixing my initial complaint. I'm not sure when there was a software update.

Navigating through prime videos can be a chore. You can't say the word movie, you have to say video.  When selecting options by number from the screen you have to be careful with what you say. I said something like play movie one thinking it would understand that the movie with a 1 on it would play. Instead it started playing a song. I had to say Alexa stop. And then go back through the voice navigation to Amazon Prime videos, then find my movie, then ask Alexa to play it.

The problem with Youtube it pulls the most popular video that is close to your description based off of key words. It doesn't go to exactly what you are asking it to pull up. Example Alexa show me Donald Trump's latest speech on you tube. It pulled a video from May 2nd which was 2 months ago. This is because the search uses keywords in this scenario Donald Trump and Speech. Then it pulls the most popular or viewed videos.

UPDATE 12/5/17 it was announced 2 hrs ago that Google is pulling the plug again on Youtube from the Echo Show and Fire TV devices. Apparently instead of working things out with Google, Amazon bypassed the block Google placed on Youtube. This is shady business Amazon! I dropped my score back down to 3 stars again because Youtube was a promised feature when I preordered my Echo show.

One thing I love about my dots and the original Alexa devices is that they are intuitive I don't have to use precise wording. My Show expects me to use precise wording to navigate and use quite a bit of features. I just left the kitchen trying to get it to go to the dim screen. I used multiple variations of turn off the screen which sometimes works.I kept getting the response sorry what device? After several attempts to get this command to work I gave up and walked out of the kitchen frustrated. Maybe it's still learning from me? *Update*  I am still having issues with it not always recognizing the turn off the screen command.I also find myself constantly having to ask the Show to turn the screen off. I don't know why it keeps turning on without me using any wake words. I heard it wake when my dogs went in to the kitchen this morning 7/19/17, yet I can walk past it all day long and it doesn't wake. Randomly I will hear my Show while I am in another room answering questions and acting on it's own with no one talking. I don't know why it does this.

The sound is hands down better than any other Alexa device. The show can put out some bass. For some reason when playing Prime movies any speech sounds a bit muffled and the sound output is significantly lower..

I placed an order with my Show and honestly it was fast and unlike my other Echos I could visually verify my order. I didn't have to pull my phone out, fumble with a keyboard, computer or tablet. I knew what I wanted said the name and probably in less than 30 seconds placed my order.

Being able to look at my lists calendar and reminders without having to pull my phone out is nice. I wish the calendar could show more than just one day at a time. Like my whole week or month. The show won't display your whole shopping list only 3 to 4 items on the screen at one time then you have to ask it to scroll down. *Update* As of 7/16/17 the Show displays 2 days on the calendar now and will scroll through events two at a time.

If you are a shopper like me that likes to browse recommendations your show will only give you a total of 12 recommendations which were no where near as accurate as my interests on my Amazon account usually are, actually they were way off. You can only view one product at a time. Basically the Show is only good for ordering when you know exactly what you want. It's not good with recommendations, and browsing items. You are limited to viewing items one at a time and then having to ask Alexa to scroll right or go right makes the process painfully slow.

 I guess the best way to explain the show. Most of what the Alexa devices were using your phone for can now be done on the show's touch screen. I still find myself listening to my Show more than looking at it, which kind of defeats the purpose of a screen. My biggest frustration with the Show is instead of operating Alexa from across the room with voice commands I find myself having to stand in front of it, or walk to it then hovering over it to navigate through the screens. I still find myself pulling my phone out of my pocket or reaching for a tablet to pull up information rather than getting up walking to the device and dealing with the frustratingly clunky voice navigation. Most of everything we use now a days is wireless, we aren't used to being restricted to a certain area to use a device. I haven't felt this way since the landline was the only way to make a call and there were no such things as cordless phones, cellphones, laptops, tablets, bluetooth, smartphones and other smart devices. This is probably why the device is more appealing for Older people, because they've spent more of their lives on devices that needed to be plugged in, like phones that had to be plugged in to phone jacks. I personally hate the idea of having to stand in front of my kitchen counter to make a video call, or running to the device to answer one.

When using the video chat feature the Show gives you a full screen view of yourself before the call is connected and a smaller window like Skype once the call is connected. With the angle of the camera and my Show sitting on the kitchen counter I had to take a few steps back, maybe 5 feet from the device so that my head would show up on the camera. As a note I am 6"" 2. Standing 5 feet away to video chat from a device with a 7 inch screen isn't as nice as using a web cam on your computer or laptop with 15+ inches from a few feet away, or a 10 inch tablet from a few feet away.

This is how I use my Show I listen to music from it (any Echo or Alexa device can do this) I add items to my grocery list ( any echo or Alexa device can do this) I can view my shopping list without having to check my phone, any tablet with Alexa can do this, your fire TV and Fire stick can also. I set reminders (any Echo device can do this) Alexa tablets can not. The Show will show you 2 calendar days or the current day. However my phone is synced and always with me and shows me the same info. You can also view this information from any Alexa enabled tablet and all Alexa enabled fire TV and Fire TV boxes. Positioning your tablet vertically will show your more days. Any Echo device without a screen will read this information to you. I ask my Show questions some times, mainly sports scores, when my teams are playing again, maybe some calculations. (Any Echo or Alexa device can do this). I set timers (any Echo or Alexa device can do this). I control all my smart home devices (Any Echo or Alexa device can do this.) I occasionally will watch a Prime movie. (Alexa tablets, Fire TV and Fire stick can do this). I listen to my Flash Briefings (Any Echo or Alexa device can do this) The Show will Show you video clips on some of the news skills. It's not like watching the news. However the Show is the only Echo or Alexa device that can do this. The only thing that really sets this device apart from the other Echo or Alexa devices is the Amazon video chat feature, which is not an enjoyable experience for me and something I rarely use. I preordered the device before any reviews or definite answers were out expecting it to be like a hands free tablet that is plugged in to a wall and could have apps installed on it. If that is your expectation you are going to be sadly disappointed. The Fire 10 HD with hands free Alexa is everything I wish the Show would have been, had it been released first I would have bought the tablet and passed on the Show. My biggest disappointment with the Echo show is, it just doesn't have much to Show.

UPDATE 3/12/18 All Fire tablets can video call and call mobile phones. The Fire 10 can do it all hands free, which was the Echo Show's only real advantage.

Why you might consider buying the Fire 7 tablet with Alexa before buying the Echo Show

I bought the Fire 7 tablet with Alexa for $30.00 during Prime day, now $49.99 (Same price as a Dot!) Here are some noteworthy comparisons. The show is limited to being plugged in to a wall and although it can be easily moved it will require a little planning as to where you might put one. The Fire 7 is obviously portable and has none of these restrictions. Both have a 7-inch, 1024 x 600 touchscreen. The Show blows the Fire 7's speakers out of the water. However you can use bluetooth with the tablet and compensate for the lack of sound quality on your device. In order to use Alexa on the tablet you have to hold down the home key for a few seconds then without using the wake word Alexa or Echo speak your command. This is a nice feature because it won't wake my other Echo devices, it will also give those worried about the always listening peace of mind. Plus it's one less thing to have to say in your list of commands. I found my tablet very responsive to my commands and could do ALMOST everything my Dot and Original Echo can do EXCEPT you can not use the newly enabled voice call feature, which to me is no big deal. Apparently you can not set reminders on the Fire 7. All of my home smart devices can be controlled from my tablet by giving the same commands I use on my other Echo devices. You can not use the Show's video chat feature. Skype, Oovoo and a few other apps are options you can take advantage of. Chances are the people you'd want to video chat with already have these services which the Show can not use and not Amazon's video chat. As a side note you don't need a Echo Show to use Amazon's drop in service it can be done straight from the Alexa app. The Echo show when it displays cards and information the whole screen is filled, where as the Fire 7 you loose about 10% of the same image that is on the Show. However unlike the Show you can rotate your screen. For those that complained about the lack of HDMI output on the Show you can pick up a micro USB to HDMI adapter with the Fire 7 tablet and fix that complaint. For those that complained there was no way to cast to your TV with the Show and other Echo devices you can cast your Prime movies straight from your Fire 7 to your Firestick or Fire TV. *Update* As of 8/5/17 I've been able to use all of my Echo devices to control my Fire TV and Fire TV stick. You can access your tablet's apps via Alexa with the Fire 7, The Show has no apps. The fire 7 also syncs instantly with your other devices in Amazon's ecosystem. Unlike the Show you can watch Netflix, Hulu,  and other streaming services on the tablet. I find myself using my Fire7 significantly more than my Show. I don't have to be in the kitchen hovering over my counter and lets just face it even a limited Amazon tablet can do a lot more than an Echo device with a screen. Think of the Fire 7 as the budget friendly tap version of the show for $80.00 less than a tap and $180.00 less than a Show. If you are on the fence about shelling out $230.00 but want to experience the Echo screen hype this may be the way to go.

Why you may consider the Fire 10 HD with hands free Alexa
You can purchase the Fire 10 HD tablet with hands free Alexa for $80.00 less than a Show or $130 less when it is on sale. Unlike the Show you can watch Netflix even command Alexa to open Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, and, other streaming services on a 10"" screen instead of just being limited to Prime videos on the 7"" screen with the show. With it's portability and always listening mode unless you have to have Amazon's video chat services. Almost all of the advantages are with the Fire 10 HD. If you are worried about the battery dying on always listening on the tablet just leave it plugged in all day and set it where ever you'd keep an Echo show and pick it up when you want to carry it around. I personally like having my tablet on my coffee table something I can't do with my Show. I bought the fire 10 with hands free Alexa and I'm happier with the purchase now I have a 10"" screen hands free Alexa I can use anywhere and can do a lot more with it. I've added a side by side comparison of the two in my pictures. In short the Fire 10 with hands free Alexa is everything I wanted the Show to be at a fraction of the cost.

We have had some good times, yes. One of my pleading strategies when nagging... Errrhm persuading my husband to buy Alexa for me was the fact that I wouldn't have to get my phone dirty when scrolling and cooking recipes. Now, I feel I was mislead. I get a large majority of my very tasty inspirations from all recipes. Alexa will only retrieve the same recipes she's already offered me and I've continuously rejected. Now I would have imagined with all the smarts over there at Amazon you all would have taught Alexa to shuffle up recipes as this was one of the main selling points. And shame on you Amazon for not recognizing that the best recipes come from allrecipes.com WTH Amazon? Get on the stick and fix this, I'm pretty sure that chick over at Google home can find me better recipes. I should have known she doesn't have great taste when she told me she picked the Eagles to win the SB. We didn't speak to each other until after the SB. I'm also from New England and Alexa doesn't get down with that thick accent🙄. I feel like the reason I wanted the ""show"" was for the recipe benefit and it is so underwhelming I rarely even use it for that. For the positives, this thing has a great speaker!!! I host Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Chris Stapleton sing offs weekly while meal prepping and for that I have found it's worth. My husband and dogs might disagree. I do enjoy that the lyrics play on the screen, you wouldn't believe the songs I had butchered before Alexa. She's a good source for news, if you can stomach to hear the turmoil happening in this beautiful country, but I digress. Overall it's a good product, I guess. But the fact she has such poor range and taste in recipes is a real turn off for something that was purchased for that reason. The echo tower has a great speaker as well, and a lot less expensive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_176?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=176&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Neither are perfect. We have two Echo Shows at this point, and the voice recognition capabilities of the Amazon system seem better than Google Home.

That being said, there's nothing better than having a screen. Because of this, the Echo Show has become our go-to device.

My favorite feature? Being able to drop in to home while traveling or at work. This feature alone makes it worth the price.

Pros:
Beautiful screen (though OLED would be preferred, particularly if you have the Show in your bedroom)
Great sound quality
Simple to use

Cons:
Large
Occasionally not as intuitive as I'd prefer
Mobile app leaves a lot to be desired, particularly when trying to use it to drop in on your Echo Shows.

On the whole, a fantastic and useful device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've used a Alexa Cube at a friends house and could see the benefits of having Alexa to answer basic day to day questions.  In hindsight I should have purchased a much cheaper cube.  I'm not finding the video ""show"" to worth the extra expense other than to watch movie trailers.  If you ask Alexa for highlights for the 2018 Major league baseball game, you get a summary of the game but no video highlights.  The cube gives you the same info.  I absolutely see no benefit for being able to watch Amazon prime movies.  The screen quality is lacking and it's much more effective to use an Ipad or even Iphone.  Asking for news highlights sometimes gives you news that's months old.  The news briefs so far has been a joke.  There is also no link up with youtube.  If that ever becomes a feature that would be a game changer.

Sometimes Alexa gives doesn't know the answer to some very basic questions.  It also seems to have a aversion to giving you any information related to shows playing on Hulu and Netflix..hmmmm.

I love having a screen! It connects well with my smart home products. Only downside is I primarily wanted it to go with my Ring Doorbell. If you are looking for it to use with Ring, it won't work well unless you have really, extremely, super, high speed  internet. Not because of the Show, but because of the Ring.com way it uses their cloud. Only other drawback is I have not had luck connecting a device with bluetooth. I have tried multiply things, from phones, to Fire, to computers, and no luck. It's the only reason it's not 5 stars. If you want to use Spotify, you have to have the premium account. But, other services work fine. The sound is great quality! If you aren't familiar with way the Echo works, check it out ahead of time, so you may enjoy it when it arrives. You have to add the Skills you want your Echo to use. And might have to practice in how you talk to your Echo product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A bit of a learning curve because I am not a techno geek, but even I got everything working (aux camera, smart plugs, etc). I have only had it a couple of weeks, but have already ordered more gadgets. The skills apps are extensive and even though the unit comes programmed with many out of the box, there seems to be plenty of apps for any age level. My friends say I've reached a new height of laziness because I don't have to get up to turn a light on or off, my girlfriend said I don't need her anymore because I have Alexa to talk to now, and I don't care! (I wanted to tell her that at least Alexa listens to me and you don't, but felt that wouldn't go over too well). I like the fact that when I get up in the morning to walk the dog, I don't have to stop to turn on the TV and get the weather first. I just ask when I get up in the morning.
And being able to set up surveillance cameras to see what's going on outside is another reason I bought it. I live in a city with a lot of crime and I feel safer being able to see outside first before going out at night.
One thing that impressed me is the quality of sound from the two speakers. And even though I want to add more speakers in the bedrooms, it fills most of the house with quality sound without needing them.
I also learned that the power company will do a free assessment and install a Smart thermostat at NO COST where I live. I am hoping it works with Alexa! Still researching that.
But overall, I think its a great invention and was immediately impressed with the unit.  Highly recommend it.
Only issue I've found is that when you link a Bluetooth speaker, the sound ceases on Echo Show. So the only way to play in separate rooms is buy an Echo Dot? It is a major drawback,","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_320?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=320&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been impressed with all of them except the Show.

It's not that it's a bad device but it doesn't live up to it potential. The screen doesn't dim when not in use, a dispute with Google has resulted in the loss of YouTube, and the sound is weak compared to the Echo.

It's also a very directional device, resulting in constant repositioning in our kitchen for different users and use cases. I ended up buying a lazy Susan for the Show to easy the rotation process. Overall I'd prefer to have the original Echo in its place in my kitchen.

On the plus side it is great in pairs for video chat and it's fun reading song lyrics while music plays.

For privacy reasons I'd like to see amazon implement a hardware switch that physically disconnects the microphones on all Echos to provide assured privacy when desired. Yes, you can unplug it but the reboot process is time consuming.

Overall I'd recommend holding off until this product is improved in future iterations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I waited and after a month it started to happen every 10 min. Now it happens all the time. I tried moving it around the house and tried different outlets thinking it was electrical interference. I unplugged it and reset it hundreds of times.  Nothing worked. My wife doesn't like the Alexa products and ridiculed me after this defective became device. I have the fire cube, echo, and dot and I love them. This product is a piece of junk. I tried returning it to amazon as I was tired of this big headache and I talked with amazon and explained to them situation. I told them this happened after the 30 day return window. They responded  by asking if I had dropped the device or spilled liquids on it!!! I am a Amazon prime member for numerous years and have spent thousands of dollars on amazon a year. I told them this is poor customer service and the best they could do is replace the device. I am saddened that a big corporation like amazon cannot make a customer happy by just accepting the return outside the window. Do not buy this device!

HE COULD WATCH ANYTHING from my bed side!!! I don't have a TV in my room and really didn't want to lug him to the living room to lay on the couch. We asked Alexa to put on our newest favorite movie Coco and he watched until he feel asleep. I immediately asked Alex to play soothing ocean sounds and BAM!! ocean sounds to the rescue to keep little man sleeping.
She also came through when my Iphone X decided that my alarm wasn't important anymore and stopped working. I am now back to the waking on time schedule!

The family enjoyed having this on the kitchen counter for early morning news and weather info, afternoon shuffling of favorite songs and evening video calls.  It would be nice to have a much larger screen to see the video content a bit further away.  As I mentioned on the title of this review, the screen started flickering and immediately contacted Amazon.  We powered cycle the device several times to no avail.  They processed my return and now it's stuck in ""Repair"" limbo and who knows when and what I'm going to get back! :(  Hopefully this can be repaired promptly and to manufacturers specification.  It's really too bad that the quality and reliability of the product is so limited.  I wish they spent a bit more in reliability and quality instead of making me wasting my time returning and waiting for a product to be repaired.  I would definitely think twice about buying Amazon electronics without at least purchasing a warranty...I don't have to do that with other name brands.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_107?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=107&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You really have to think about how to word the question and also by looking at little examples that they tell you how to ask questions. When I set it up for her we called my aunt and her last name is long and what Alexa thought we said was very funny. There are different apps to enable on her and that might be why she didn’t know some questions. You really have to speak clearly though there is a set up for her to learn how you speak.

Alexa has the range for hearing your requests, and can do the simple stuff; play a movie, make a call, tell me the weather. The ""task"" loading is a bit arduous just because they're not particularly well defined, so if you want her to show you a News reel or something you have a bit of a challenge. For the most part, the device is very straight forward, decent speakers, okay video, picks up phonecalls good, does a heckuva job with music and audiobooks.

I use this one in my office for two reasons: (1) I have an alexa camera ($60) installed in another room in my office. I tell Alexa to ""Show me Conference Room"" and up pops the picture of what's going on in there, and (2) When it's idle, I tell Alexa to ""Show me Pictures of the Beach"" and it displays all my photos of family in and around the water. I don't know how it picks out just pictures depicting the beach.

Truly amazing.  I have a daughter who lives and works in Turkey. I tell alexa to ""Show me the photos of Turkey"" and up pop hundreds of family photos taken in Turkey.

I don't know how I lived without it.

=====

Update. The device automatically reverts back to the home screen every 15-20 minutes. Makes it impossible to use as a monitor in my office as I have to constantly tell it to ""Show me the Camera""! No way to turn this feature off. Second, after a week, it lost it's connection to the camera monitored through wifi. The camera works great. I can see it on my Iphone, but no matter what I do, I can't get the Echo Show to find it.

Very disappointed. What I am left with is a echo dot with a screen. Worthless.

Update: Will Amazon STOP displaying the inane messages on the screen. Or at least allow the user to turn them off.

Its just so cool to just say what you want and that way you can start dinner or put up the Groceries with no extra effort. The Echo Show was so easy to setup,.It Barely took me 5 minutes. The most difficult thing was waiting for the updates to load up which was pretty quick too. The only issue I have with the Echo is totally my fault.

It is placed in kitchen counter, which is the best location for showing receipts hands-free and playing music. However, the microphones, several of them, placed at the top of Echo Show. Since the screen is slightly tilted backwards for a better viewing angle, the microphones are now tilted towards the back. This makes them not the best to pick voice across the room over the time, it is getting worse.

Now everyone in the family knows, if you want Echo Show's attention, you will have to raise your voice. It's not mean, but inconvenient for sure. Have searched around Amazon's website to look for customer service, but didn't find a solution.

If you are looking forward to have a helper in the kitchen, avoid first generation Echo Show, give second generation a try, with their newly positioned microphone at the front, or something other brands, like google home.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_192?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=192&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I researched it and thought it had it, but missed the most recent update explaining that google can’t get amazon to collaborate with them on an app. Sounds like the ball is in Amazon’s court. This thing, without youtube, the Echo Show is so-so.

Family in other countries will probably not be able to use the video call features. But I look forward to using it with the hubby. I love the white... but a white cord would really be nice. Seeing the lyrics when songs play is pretty cool. And parts of our calendar popped up. I like that, but wonder if it will work with my phone, as... I use google. And, Google and Amazon don’t seem to play nice. I get it. But having to have different devices would be expensive for consumers.

Lastly, I like the sound. The speakers are ample. And they don’t pump out ridiculous farting base like many speakers. I’ve never been a fan of that.

They are excellent devices and have taken the place of our entertainment center Amazon Music; instead there is an Echo Show in the Kitchen, and one in the Bedroom.  We can now play music throughout the house from Amazon Prime account.  Today we hooked up a cam to it, last month we hooked up a smart plug to control the light by the dog's dining area for night time.

The features are great, reminders, alarms, shopping lists and links to your phone so you can see what you need, add things to your Amazon shopping list also, and it is an instant encyclopedia.  I use it to get morning news flash, and then set the music on low while we get ready for work.

Our mother lives in a group home and we thought the Echo Show would be the most awesome thing since email!!!!  I chatted with 3 different Amazon support reps and read as many reviews as I could.  No one ever mentioned you need a phone to use the Echo Show.  We wanted to give this to the home so all of the families would be able to enjoy video chats.  It is now 2 months after Prime Day and we are finally returning this Echo Show.  I chatted before and after with several reps making sure this would work the way we wanted.  First I connected it to my account and phone.  The problem there was every single one of my contacts were in the contacts of Mom's Echo.  I didn't want anyone having my personal and professional contacts so I was told I needed a different Amazon account for Mom's Echo.  OK, that done we still couldn't add any contacts, play full songs, or anything else.  Finally yesterday we called Amazon and spoke with Andy.  He was the first and only person to tell us that we needed to have a phone with no contacts in order to use it as we wanted.  I should of found this out the first or at very latest the second time I asked.  I was always very clear about what we wanted to do and it took all this time and frustration in order to find out we can't use it the way we wanted.  So no video chats with our Mom or anyone in the home.  Andy was very helpful and set it up for us to return one Echo Show and gave me $15 additional credit for all of our frustration and wasted time!!!  We love our Echo Show and purchased 2 more to go around the house.  I warn everyone before buying any of these devices make sure you have a phone to attach it to!!!!  My other reviews of our other devices are 99% awesome!!!!  Amazon I am so disappointed in the support I received, the credit given, and all of the frustration and wasted time.  I don't know if I will ever go back to being the 100% happy Amazon shopper and supporter.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No YouTube BUT....","August 1, 2018","I really do dig this little device! I know it’s more expensive than the rest of the amazon smart home devices & it doesn’t play YouTube any longer BUT... I really like having this around! I’m not nuts about the design( I think they could’ve gone a bit more futuristic or funky with the design like it’s little sis, the amazon dot. I believe it has better microphones for  listening & finds info easier than the (no screen device) echo does. I really do like that you can see & read what Alexa is saying on the screen & see the weather as she is giving it to you. The YouTube thing( I hope) is just a hiccup for a bit while they sort their differences out( between amazon & google) & it returns back to the amazon show. But for the time being... I’ll watch news, weather & play games on it till then. Some of the apps I believe slow the device down but since I’ve powered it down & back up its worked quicker since I’ve put the apps on it that slowed it down to begin with. I like it and recommend it. So.... COME ON AMAZON & GOOGLE... GET THOSE DIFFERENCES WORKED OUT SO WE CAN HAVE YOUTUBE BACK ON THE DEVICE! Or I’m afraid Google will ultimately win this battle with their future products especially since YouTube is such a big deal on these devices!

My husband can’t work a computer and can’t type, so he loves being able to talk to Alexa to get information. I ordered lots of AudioBooks for him which he listens to every night. I even bought him a Sling so he can have Alexa outside with him while he works.

We also use them as intercoms, as you’re able to connect through each one to talk to another. And I got one for my daughter so she can video call here from her house (I even get to see and talk to her dog LOL).

Complete voice control over volume. And we got the Hue light bulbs so we control all our lights with voice. We get weather and news whenever we want and plenty of music. I’ve even figured out how to put my own music on them (from various sources).

My nephew comes over and loves the available games. I’m thinking of getting him one so he can call me through video. I even set it up so it turns our tv on and off, when necessary. Being able to view my calendar events is nice too.

Setting an alarm by voice command is so easy. I had a problem once on it showing ALL our AudioBooks and the developers went to work on the problem and got it fixed, so I’m very happy with their response to issues.

There is some basic setup necessary through the app. I’m computer savvy so I have no problems setting up tech items. Perhaps those who gave bad reviews have not fully set up the Echo to do all it is capable of doing, as I don’t get how you can give this item a bad review.

All in all, we adore our Shows, Sling, Hue Lights, etc. They’re constantly updating them. Keep the advances coming!!

Looking further into this, it tells you that you can only connect to people who have an echo device and have the Amazon Alexa app.  I even purchased the Echo Connect that plugs into your land line thinking that would help, nope.  Do not purchase this unless the contacts you want to facetime with have the Alexa App on their smart phone and a registered account.

After waiting an unreasonably amount of time, I received the same device without the wall adaptor.  I called amazon expecting them to send me at least the adaptor that came with the Echo Show but I was told that I would have to order one and they would gladly send me another one.  I was further told that for my inconvenience they would not charge me for the adaptor.  Well, how nice of them. they shouldn't charge me anyway,because it was their incompetence that caused me not to have an adaptor.  After speaking to several kind foreigners, I was transferred to customer service where I spoke to ""Rally"", a fellow American who was very condescending and refused to allow me to speak to his supervisor.

Awful with 2 or more devices.","July 13, 2017","We took the bait and bought 2 Shows.  (I was confident that Amazon would produce a quality product).  Wrong.
Here is my experience:
1)  I spent over 2 hours with tech support trying to get my devices to accept calls from each other.  Setting aside the fact that English is not the first language of tech support plus the fact that they apparently have limited if any experience with the product, it was at times incredibly difficult and frustrating to understand what was being said.  I lost track of the number of times I had to say ""I don't understand what you said"".
2)  Each contact person I spoke with REQUIRES:  spelling my email address, slowly pronouncing my name, stating my account name,  repeating my house number, street address, city and state. I ended up doing this 4 times as I was 'shuttled' to someone who was a more advanced 'tech support' person.  Plus I had to repeat the entire reason I called to each person.  Hello?  Here is an idea:  ""Share the caller's information with other employees as the call is passed up the support line.""  Can't you use AWS to solve this problem?
3)  It turned out that the inability to call another Show device was the result of needing to link to a second account which would be connected to the 2nd Show device.  OK.  That worked.  (It took 1.5 hours to figure that one out)
4)  This begs the question ""Do I need a separate account for each Show I purchase?  What if I want a 3rd in my kitchen?
5)  So, I call tech support ... again.  They inform me that I do not need another account for a 3rd Show but I do need to 'turn on' Drop-In.  If I do not have Drop-In turned on it will not work?  Huh?  Why is that?  They can not say.
6)  The summary of this situation is that as 'kewl' as the produce idea is, Amazon Show is not ready for real customer use.  (It probably works well if you want to purchase just 1; but given their enticing offer of $100 off if you buy 2, I must say ""If that is your need, look elsewhere."")  They should have a)  trained their support staff on the product and it's features and b) beta tested multiple product use.  But, apparently Amazon uses it's customers as beta testers.

We already have the Spot, but it doesn't show Blink camera's, yet.......
I wanted something that will show me ALL my security cameras in one place, and I could just voice activate to show each one.
I finally found it!
This was on sale, and I jumped on it.

First off, I can now see my 2 outdoor Nest cams, 2 XD Blink Outdoor cams, a Logitech outdoor cam, and our Ring Doorbell.  All we have to do is tell it to 'show me xxxxx', and there it is!  The large screen is perfect to set on top of our entertainment center and view from 15 feet away.

With the Ring, when someone rings your doorbell or there is motion, it will not activate this device.  Ring hasn't perfected that yet.  You have limited settings for the cams, using this device, but you CAN view all of them.

Yes, they time out after 30 minutes.  This device isn't really made to be a security 24/7 monitor.  You would get burn in!

Using this device for other than viewing our cameras is an awesome addition to our living room.
If we need to add something to our Fresh order, just speak it. :)

BE AWARE:  If you put this close to your speakers for your local TV, the news people LOVE to say ALEXA for some reason.  Which will activate it.  We changed our activate word to Echo and there have been far less 'ghost' activations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_458?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=458&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I actually bought this for my boyfriend when it was on sale to cheer him up. He loves new technologies and the idea of AIs running our homes. This was supposed to be a present for him.

I now use Alexa more than he does. I was very surprised by how useful she is and I was blown away by all the different skills I can have her do. It's way more useful than I was lead to believe originally. We actually set her up with my account since I have prime.
I love that when I'm cleaning in my bathroom I can say ""Alexa, play jungle noises"", she can hear me, and that the speaker is loud enough to hear in the bathroom without it being to over whelming loud when I go back into the main room. Which always deterred me from listing to music/ambient noise while cleaning before. With the added benefit of me not having to stop what I'm doing if I change my mind and want to listen to something different.

I really like that your calendar events show up on the screen. It's been super helpful reminding my boyfriend when I work and when all our appointments are coming up. I also like that it shows different things you can try, and news story headlines that you can ask more about.

I've very happy with this device, my boyfriend still gets frustrated at times with Alexa. She doesn't recognize some commands and will do the wrong thing. When he tries to have her remind him of something he gives her all the info at once, which is usually when she messes up. I think if you keep the commands simple, it helps. It might take a tiny bit longer, but she'll do it correctly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_105?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=105&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use my Amazon Echo to play music, check weather, etc. all the time. Set-up was easy just like the other devices. Everything I own is on the same Wi-Fi network, but the only thing I have trouble with is the Echo Show. Gaming on Xbox One: Great. Streaming videos on my Smart TV: no problem. Ipad and Ipod: no issues. Amazon Echo and Dot: run like Champs.
All I hear from the Echo Show (after a long pause) is: ""I am having problems playing your music right now."" "" I am having trouble connecting right now."" Or my personal favorite: ""I don't understand."" I don't understand why I bought it.

I am quite impressed with the show. It plays very well with my Nest thermostat and camera, and Hue and Wemo lights. I really like being able to read the lyrics of songs, words otherwise that are not discernible. When added to the group of echo devices, the lower fidelity of the show, compared to the echo devices, is not noticed as much. I love viewing my photos on the 7 inch screen. The ability to change the background to your own photo is nice. Watching Amazon movies with the show on my lap couldn't be better. Maybe if I had owned the show when the capability to watch YouTube was available, then taken away, I would be disappointed too. Maybe I wouldn't be as impressed if I had paid full price, but I purchased mine for considerable less on the deal of the day.

Many people wrote in to say that it worked great for an elderly parent and I brought 2 to do video chat with a 80 year old friend.  EVERYONE stated that not having a smart phone would not be a issue.  However, you need the contact list in a smart phone in order to set up you can call.

I have LIFX light bulbs and the Ring doorbell and cameras. I got the Echo Show and set it up. I said ""alexa, show me the front door"" and the ring was on the screen and I saw the front door. ""alexa, Quit"" and the app closed. The trick to getting to put this in the kitchen was to get the approval of my wife. She is not as enamored with technology as i am. So I showed her the alexa show, and she said ""so, what can it do?"" I said ""alexa show me the front door"" and the ring doorbell image came on. This she liked. She likes being able to have the security of viewing who is at the front door. Both she and I thought that when someone would ring the bell the Ring Doorbell image that I get on my phone we also show up on the Echo Show. We were pretty disappointed that when the doorbell rang, and I ask alexa ""show me the front door"" it cannot and claims it cannot get on the ring system. I bet this is something that can be fixed by Ring Doorbell and Alexa Show, If they want this to work as I described. Maybe the Ring and Alexa Show aren't playing that well together. I don't know. But I know this, if the ring doorbell shows on echo show screen when someone rings the doorbell, this is going to be a BIG WINNER for both the Ring and Echo Show. The video I posted shows what it says when it does not do what you want. While the camera isn't responding to ECHO SHOW, it did respond to my iPhone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Payed top dollar.  While waiting for delivery my children gave me Sonos with Alexa.  Loved it.  Received Echo Show and was going to return it but life got in the way and it was the past 30 days.  So I sent it to my cottage in Maine.  Got it hooked up and absolutely love it.  My neighbors love it too.  Not only does it play my favorite music, it shows recipes and movies.  I really like it for a quick recipe.  I asked for Oysters Rockefeller and it gives me 5-6 recipes with photos.  (Oysters are fabulous here in Maine).
  I am having a problem though.  I use to be able to ask Alexa to put something on shopping list and it went on my phone Alexa App under shopping list.  For some reason that feature stopped.  I cannot get it to work.  If anyone has a suggestion let me know.

Being able to get radio stations from other areas is a plus.  I can find out what is going on in my hometown.  We are still experimenting with Echo to find out all we can do.  The periodic emails with suggestions are useful but a little incomplete. If you do not want to spend more for the add-ons of programming, etc. you don't need to and Echo is still solid.

He did explain a few things most of which should be included in a small manual if they had one. By biggest peeve is the constant ""Hints"" of what to try by asking Alexa. I've been using Alexa for quite some time. Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus, so the constant hints are annoying. Nick did follow up and agreed they at this time can't be turned off. So, still 2 stars.
Update: Using my photo's as a background for the Display, it's supposed to change pictures every 10  minutes. (That's a default time that is not user changeable). Well, the 10 minutes is whenever it feels like it. Now we are down to 1 star.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_246?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=246&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use it as an alarm clock every day and it reads Audible books to me every night to help me get to sleep.  I have WEMO and HUE lights that it works with.  No issues on these.  She has issues sometimes waking up and hearing you the first time so you have to repeat yourself due to the screen having to come on I believe.  Currently YouTube is blocked from her as of the time of this review due to the crappy implementation of it.  Google is blocking it because Amazon is not following the proper API to implement YouTube on the Show.  I side with
Google on this because I would like to be able to log in and have my subscriptions and suggestions available and not the random videos it pops up.  She needs more apps that utilize the touch screen.  I'd like to be able to control my lights without having to talk at night and listen to her say ""okay"".  The screen is pretty nice and has good color.  I put my favorite photos on Amazon so I can use them as backgrounds.  I'd like to be able to turn everything off on the screen to use it as a photo frame when I'm not talking to her.  Not that I ""talk"" to her, just sayin.  Overall I see a lot of potential in the Show that Amazon is dragging their feet on and not implementing useful features.  I can't remember all the features enabled in her.  How about ""Alexa, show icons""  so I can pick something out instead of having to use the app to see what's currently activated Amazon??  Would I buy it again?  I would for what I'm currently using it for.  I like that the screen goes black at night when ""do not disturb"" is set and I can just touch her to wake the screen or snooze the alarm.  I like that I can tell her to stop reading after x minutes so she doesn't keep reading all night long.  The weather app could be better but is still useful.  The calendar is kind of a let down because she can't actually show a calendar.  How hard is that Amazon?  Hopefully she gets there eventually.  I'd like to see official forums for people to discuss features and issues with support reading along too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The only problem I had during set-up was connecting it to my Philips Hue lights.  I could not get it to control individual lights upon initial set-up. I then decided to call customer support for Alexa and they were very helpful.  We were able to resolve the issue by going into the Alexa app and assigning my individual Hue lights to groups.  Once the groups were established with group names, I was then able to control them with Alexa.
The speakers on the Alexa Show sound great, but I prefer the ability to connect Show to my Bluetooth speaker and play the music I choose with the Show through this speaker.  I then get the album artwork and lyrics on the Show.
If you decide to purchase the Show, you will not be disappointed. It is nice asking Alexa for help with various things or questions and getting a visual with it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They are all used heavily.  I debated for a while if the advatages of this device outweigh just using the Kindle Fire's built in Alexa feature.  In the end I decided that it's superior sound and always on state would be worth the price compared to the Kindle Fire.

During Christmas time it went on sale and I replaced the Echo on my kitchen counter with the Show.  It's easily the best part of the kitchen!  In fact, because of my small kitchen space the Echo had to be placed in the corner which muffled the Echo's sound somewhat.  The Show throws the sound directly through the front which for me was an improvement.  This does recipes and has a beautiful fish tank screensaver.  Also shows the whole week's weather forecast.

As far as security, since I have a Ring doorbell I can say, ""Alexa, show me my front door"" and the Echo will connect to the Ring and I get a live picture of my front porch, great for deciding whether or not to answer the door.

After reading early reviews, I held off on buying one until they had a considerable sale on them around the holidays.

The microphones do a very nice job of picking up my voice, the sound is surprisingly good for a unit that only has twin 2"" speakers and no passive bass radiator(s) or ports - I'd put it in the same class as the first generation Echo, sound-wise, but obviously more directional, given the speaker layout.  It's also in stereo, a feature lacking on most of the other Alexa devices (the Tap being the exception.)  Granted, Dots and second-generation Echos do allow for stereo out via the 3.5mm audio jack.

I was surprised that Amazon's new ""flagship"" model doesn't have an audio-out jack.  There's just one plug, and it's for power.

Screen is sharp, clear, and plenty bright.  It has a light sensor about halfway between the camera and the top left edge, hidden by the smoked plastic frame around the screen that will automatically dim the screen based on the level of light in the room.  It reminds me of the 80's Sony Trinitrons that had the ""Lumisponder"" feature or the self-dimming alarm clocks that do the same thing.  Pretty convenient.  Not all songs on Prime Music have lyrics, but a majority of the things I've played have album artwork that displays on the screen, and lyrics, when available, can be turned on and off.

I have to get back to the sound again - it sounds great, and I've never had a need to turn it up to 10 except for testing purposes.  I frequently crash out on the couch and stream Prime movies and TV shows next to me on a Fire HD 8 tablet, which impressed me with it's sound from such tiny speakers, but this thing has a lot more going for it, sound-wise.  It's like comparing the speakers on current LCD TVs to the dual 6x9"" speakers that would come in the CRT ""console TV"" cabinets.  There's just more room inside this for the sound to resonate and deliver a much richer sound.

If you're used to the Echos (first and second gen, Dots as well,) you'll notice that the glowing ring is absent on these.  Instead, the blue ""listening"" mode is indicated by a small band on the bottom of the screen, and notifications like messages appear as a ""speech bubble"" icon on the top right with the number of unread ones on it.  You can ask it to play them with your voice, or tap the icon instead.  The microphone off button is replaced with a button that turns off the microphones and the camera, and a small red LED lights up between the light sensor and the camera.  Also missing is the ""action button"" found on the Show's siblings, this is the one that you can press instead of saying the wake word.  You've got volume up, down, and the one that turns off the mic/camera.  Device weighs a little more than the first generation Echo or the newer Echo Plus, but not by much, and naturally takes up a little bit more room on a table.

Another thing to note, if you subscribe to the Alexa email newsletter, you'll find that between trending stories that show up on the screen, the familiar [Try ""Alexa, do this or that""] phrases cycle through on the screen.  It's normal resting screen will show the clock, but when it senses movement, the screen switches to playing screen-saver style pictures with the time, current weather, and the trending topics/tips for a few minutes.  You can follow the suggestion on-screen to vocally tell it to show the story, or just tap the screen to bring it up.

I hadn't planned on being this long-winded in this review, but I'm genuinely impressed with this device.  It would be great if it had an audio-out plug, and a battery like the Tap, but overall, I think this device has come a long way since being released.  The built-in camera really wasn't a selling point for me, but I could see it coming in handy if you do video calls.  I did test the camera, though (which you can turn on and off with your voice,) and it took a pretty clear picture.  Just not a feature that I personally will be using much, if at all.

One final note that I just remembered, setting the device up with your wifi is even more simple than others, I've never had to use the app - I take it to my neighbor's and all the available wifi spots show up directly on the screen itself, so you can just tap on the right one and enter the password directly on the device instead of using your phone/tablet/etc.

Bottom line:  Satisfied with the purchase.  Probably wouldn't pay full price, but when they're on sale for the regular price of the new ""Echo Plus,"" it was a gamble that I'm glad I took.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_216?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=216&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In the bedroom I can tell Alexa it is Sexy Time and the lights dim and turn purple and light jazz music starts playing (yes got the eye roll from my wife for that one, but its still used, lol).  One thing I am concerned about is the listening aspect, not sure I buy that no one is.  We will NEVER use ""Drop-In"" other than for our household devices only, the thought of someone dropping in on us anytime and seeing or hearing us is quite disturbing, there should be something asking you for permission first and very glad that can be disabled for outside of the home use.

It has a lot of potential however it is like a locked cell phone. It works well with Amazon services, but its general utility as an Internet device is very limited. The picture on its screen is quite sharp and the sound quality is as good as most moderately priced table radios. The clock is a nice size, but would be better if it included more informaion such as day/date and local outside temperature. The timer functions are useful and the weather report display is good. Alexa's ability to provide information appears to be mostly limited to Wickipedia entries. It makes shopping on Amazon a little too easy which could lead to unintended consequences. It works quite well with Amazon Prime movie and music services, however if you are not a Prime member access to Internet based media is sharply limited. The video conferencing feature may be useful if you know someone else with an Echo Show otherwise not so much. It is primarily a marketing device which is Ok if you wish to confine your purchasing to Amazon's offerings. It also collects information on your questions and purchases which allows Amazon to target you with ""deals"" they feel you  may want. There is also the issue of having a very sensitive microphone  and video camera inside your home. You can supposedly disble them ... Personally I unplug it at night or when I am not using it. Also every question you ask Alexa is stored somewhere in the ""Cloud"". Again you can supposedly edit the conversations but there may always be a backup somewhere.  Everything that is done on the web ultimately becomes a part of some Google database somewhere. If you are happy living within the Amazon Universe it could be a useful device. It also appears to have a lot of games and other features that can be added. (In Echo ease these are refered to as ""Skills"".) An unlocked version that allowed unfettered access to the internet would be a more desireable product. Despite its technical sophistication it's limitation of access to alternate media and information sources greatly reduces its consumer value. By providing a captive audience and copious amounts of consumer data this device benifits Amazon far more than any of its customers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_289?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=289&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love the Echo Show.  The $229 price was spendy, I'd wait for a sale to get it.

I set one up on the kitchen counter and my kids listen to audio books while they eat breakfast. So far they are halfway through Ready Player One.
I’ve caught my son listening to some weird rap on Spotify and my daughter is always asking Alexa to tell her a joke. Thankfully Alexa keeps the jokes clean because I know she shares them with her 3rd grade class.
I just set up two of the new Amazon Cloud Cams. They were a piece of cake to set up, have great video, and linked seamlessly to the Echo Show. I finally feel like I’ve got a connected home.
My next step is to get some of those voice controlled lights and figure out how to link my thermostat. Then I will feel like Captain Picard while sitting on my couch - “Computer - lights and a cup of Earl Gray...”","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_477?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=477&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've tried out most of the features and they work well.  This includes watching video, checking the weather, taking pictures, scanning barcodes, sending messages, calling other echo devices, and video conferencing.  I video conference with a Echo Spot and it worked fine.  No major lag.  Picture is super clear.  I also like the reminder feature, as it shows me all reminders and upcoming reminders.

The Bad: The design is a bit clunky.  It's like a weirdly shaped right triangle.  Also, one of the pixels was burned out on mine when I received it.  It's very small, but noticeable.  The list price is a little pricey in my opinion.  One last thing, and probably my biggest issue.  I had some preconception that this would be ipad or Fire like, in the sense that I could choose apps and open them.  No.  Not the case.  It is essentially a big spot.  This is fine, but no Netflix or Hulu so it's a bit disappointing.

The Final Word: It's a fun device to have in your kitchen and as part of your Amazon ecosystem.  Worth it if you can get it on sale or if you are really into all the Echo products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It seems like I had the system down to just giving me the time and weather on the screen, but now the ""Try"" is back telling me to do the things I already know that I can do. I was so happy when I found a way to turn off the constant headlines and change the background to a slowly changing slideshow of my photos, but I couldn't turn off the ""try"" thing. Then the ""try"" thing just went away and I was thrilled. Now the ""try"" is back and I'm really frustrated. Still no option to turn it off.

This would be a nice gift for people if it wouldn't drive them crazy.

It is a decent system, but somewhat more intrusive than the regular Echo. It gives you the sense that they're always watching, mostly because the system will react when you enter the room. Sort of creepy. Also, the flashing blue ring isn't as pretty as on the Echo; it's just part of the screen.

By denying me the ability to turn off the ""Try"" suggestion, I start to wonder if this is just some sort of electronic billboard in my kitchen. I don't need a billboard and you probably don't need one, either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been living with this device on my nightstand since 2017.... great alarm clock but for the life of me I can't see any other use for it. Amazon needs to get internet videos back like you tube. What's more they need to make it with a mini stereo jack so you can plug it into your stereo! The Echo Show continues to be the worst performing device in the lineup. I own the 1st Alexa (great device) an Amazon Tap (love!!) two Amazon Dots 1st generations (awesome!) and the Amazon Show (Flop!!)
UPDATE: Without YouTube what's the point!! This thing gets worse every day!! not worth the $!! Use non video Echo Devices!!

While some features are made easier such as lists and voice messages...I've found that my 'Show' has a few short-comings.
1. Microphone 1 star; The microphone is easily distracted by ambient noise. Sometimes it takes 15 attempts to get the 'Show' to turn off its screen. it constantly claims not to hear.
2. Screen 3 stars: The screen is excellent for shopping lists and to do lists. BUT if you ask the 'Show' for movies you get a short assortment of  movies Amazon offers a large number of which are 'prime'!!
3. Calendar 0 Stars: If you run an apple phone the 'Show' requires you to turn on apple's double security to use it which makes your iPhone a nightmare to use! So forget Calendars its not compatible.
4. Nightlite 2 starts: The screen is very difficult to turn off and there is no manual switch for it. So unless you like a bright room to sleep in even on its lowest brightness setting you'll have to toss a towel over it.
5. Prime Movies 1 star: you cannot ask it to play Amazon Prime Movies because she'll just say she can't do that.
6. You tube 1 star: if you ask for 'tiny homes' it gives you a short list to choose from and if you come back later wanting to see other tiny house videos 'Show;' will bring you back to the exact line-up of videos; convincing 'Show' to go further is an exercise in patience...better just love re-watching the same videos!
The list goes on from here but you get the picture. A good idea but too many kinks","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_136?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=136&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would NOT buy this until more changes are made, i do not think is worth the 229 price tag it has, and I think this is why they have sales that dropped the price to 160.

I have mine on a shelf easy view of my office when I talk with friend she or customers. I did notice it gets really warm after a long video call. One last think I was miss led from a review, you cannot connect all your echos to make one large sound system.

When not otherwise busy, there are hints of what might be fun to ask, but they rotate quickly and unless you are focusing on the Show, pass by so fast that I do not have time to think of whether I am interested or not.

1) Sound quality: I am an Amazon Prime subscriber - this allows listening to music as well as creating limited playlists.  For the kitchen, the sound quality is acceptable.  I was surprised to see a song's lyrics pop up on the screen (an addictively fun feature).  Non-Amazon Prime/Prime Music subscribers will not care about the sound quality.
2) Although smaller than a Tablet, the screen is large enough that recipes can displayed; however, the speakers are directly below the screen and ""stuff"" such as flour can get into the holes.
3) You can play YouTube videos and the video quality is quite good.
4) The power cord is surprisingly long, a very smart feature.

Cons:
1) it is very pricy.  You'll have to decide on getting 4 Echo Dots (with change left over), 2 Echo Spots (with change left over) or 1 Echo Show.  I wanted to see what ""Show"" is like.  It is difficult for me to recommend ""Show"" due to the high price; however, I do like it.
2) While a large footprint is to be expected, it does take up quite a bit of space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After initial excitement and benefits, I am disappointed with the overall experience of the First-gen Show.  The good features are the visual cues and the video calling which was the purpose of the replacement.  Video calling works great with other Echo Show owners.

However, there are more negatives than positives.  The first disappointment was the audio quality.  Our echo is in a central location in our kitchen, so we enjoyed the 360 degree speakers of the first-gen echo.  The First-gen echo show has dual front speakers, so we only get audio in one direction.

After only 3 months, the screen started to deteriorate.  Ghost images and reflections would appear under bright text and start to degrade the experience.  Upon talking to customer service and resetting multiple times, the problem did not go away and I even noticed screen burn-in.  The time which is almost always displayed on the screen appeared on dark screens when not in use.

Amazon customer service did determine that the unit was defective and has processed a replacement.  I was disappointed that they would not allow me to pay to upgrade my device to the 2nd-generation model that was just released.  I fear that my replacement will suffer from the same issues as the original and was hoping to upgrade for a better screen and audio experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_59?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=59&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It would bluetooth over to an audio receiver with dobly 7.1.  I replaced the DOT with this SHOW in hopes that having a screen with the calendar to remind me of what I had to do that day.  Well this thing would not connect to blue tooth besides my phone for a month.  Then it was updated and it would connect but would lose the connection at which point I would have to move my furniture to unplug it and plug it back in because the wire is built into the bottom of it.  Then it was updated some more and that did make it to where I didnt have to unplug it 2 or 3 times a day and it was working better.  Here recently it updated again and now it cuts out really bad on the audio from Tunein and Pandora and I have to unplug the bluetooth audio receiver instead of the echo show.

Keep moving along. 👎🏽","July 26, 2018","We got this Echo for $100 off on Prime Day and thank goodness for that! There’s very little reason to buy this device if you have another echo. If you don’t have Prime I wouldn’t at all. No YouTube, no Netflix, no video except Prime Video. The only reason to get this is for video and there’s very little video to watch!

To give you an idea of how useless this device is, you can’t even search Prime Video. If you open it you’re given 25 choices. No way to even see what else there is to watch. So you need to browse on another device then go to the Echo and if you’re lucky it will play it for you. Half the time it opens a song or something else instead. It shouldn’t be this hard.

You have HBO? Can’t watch that unless you subscribe WITH Amazon. Forcing you to use their services is money grubbing and very consumer UNfriendly. You have Twitch? It’s an Amazon service so certainly this must work right? Well, not very well. It takes several steps to get to channel you want to watch and it streams Very Poorly. LOTS of lags and Juttering. The Twitch skill is extremely basic (no chat, no following, subbing or anything else. It barely plays.) and a much better experience on a phone.

Nothing on the Show works Well. Most skills work, but with an asterisk. It demonstrates just how poor th Echo platform is in general. After hearing of how poorly Amazon treats and pays its workers especially on Prime day I’m leaning towards completely leaving Amazon.

It's going back.","July 8, 2018","Our family really had high hopes for the Echo Show, but we are disappointed in the current product.

The good: Nice form factor, good audio (amazing, actually), screen is OK.

The bad: Our primary use case for the Show was as a ""kitchen helper"" - to search for, retrieve and display recipes.  Unfortunately, we neglected to read all of the comments for the reviews regarding the few available recipe skills before we ordered the Show - and no matter how nice the device looks it isn't useful if it can't do some of the basics, such as scroll up / down or left / right on a recipe's ingredients list or recipe instructions.  Sometimes when you ask the Show for a recipe it will read back the request and then the screen just goes blank and the audio quits.  On an Echo in the same room the same recipe gets read back without an issue.

Our secondary use case was to be able to ""Show Front Door Camera"" - all our security cameras run only on our LAN and have private IP addresses.  But the Show (and the Amazon Alexa / Lambda infrastructure) won't allow you to connect to cameras on your local area network!  Another FAIL.

Voice recognition is beyond useless when compared to our other Echo devices.  Even saying the suggested ""Ask Alexa to ..."" tips don't work reliably.  Either there is a design or hardware problem or the software badly needs an update.  And speaking of Tips, why can't you turn off the useless, repetitive ""Ask Alexa to ..."" tips on the Home Screen?  And  why isn't there any listing of skills specific to Show-enabled devices?

We'll return this one and wait for the next generation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had a lot of difficulty with the setup, and the help site did not address the issue. I tried calling a help line, was put on hold for about 15 minutes, and then a pleasant recorded voice came on and said goodbye. I finally solved the setup issue on my own, somewhat by luck. The issue I had was that I could not get the Show to make any calls. Every time I tried making a call, It told me I needed to register the Alexa app on my phone. After uninstalling and reinstalling three times with the registration process, I gave up on that. I have an older version android phone (approximately three years old). I discovered that the Alexa app does not work with older android operating systems. Nowhere in the setup instructions or product description does it say what the minimum operating system needs to be. Luckily, my wife has a newer iphone and by luck I was able to complete the setup from that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I dont understand all the negative reviews stating no Youtube. I actually had to go check mine to see if it was no longer accessable. On demand, Alexa took me right to it! I'm thinking people are basing their opinions just by others reviews. I for one love this device and have purchased a total of 4 so far as gifts(from QVC & AMAZON). The display is crisp, the sound is rich and its a quality build. I still use the original Echo tower. These devices only get better with age as they're constantly self updating.
If you're on the fence based on negative reviews, dont hesitate. If you purchase now you have until Jan 31 to return. What have you got to lose?
 Personally, I give it 5 stars and an additional two thumbs up.😊

*Update: ok so I go back to youtube just now and receive alert that its no longer availble. I have to trust that Amazon will play nice and do the right thing so this matter will be resolved soon.

Easy initial set up. The phone ""Alexa app"" was a bit confusing at first. The phone integration concept still need some work, and I still do not understand if Amazon eves-drops and records conversations per there agreement or if that part is exempt from the policy.  A VoIP would be a nice interrogation instead of requiring a land line or cell-phone. And the contacts import is not user friendly or well thought out!  I would prefer to have a contact list on my cell phone and a different one on the Echo Show. I have to go through my contacts and delete many of them to avoid confusion! I called my mother using the device after figuring out the app on my cell phone. The voice quality on my end was good ( a bit rich in the base) but the connection on her end she describe as sounding like I am talking from across the room in which I was about three feet away from the device.
  It is a great music player using the Amazon music app.. only a few songs that were not available, and I tried hard to stump them.
The blocking of google and U tube is Unprofessional! I really don't mind the google so much but U tube has a bunch of DIY video's that I watch when I struggle with a project. And that is part of the basis for 3 stars. It would be nice to be able to work on learning coding from watching a U tube video instead of switching windows on my PC, or any of the other robotics / IT integration lessons.
The Acoustics leave a lot to be desired.. not the worst but I enjoy a more stereo environment when listening to music. Maybe offering Bluetooth satellite speakers in the bundle and keeping the Echo as a center channel would offer a far more satisfying music experience. It does have decent base tones for such a small devise, but the addition of a front firing sub-woofer would help also. At least as an option for those of us who enjoy the full dynamics of music.

The home automation features I will look into at a later date in time. They are a bit pricey for my budget. When the have a smart coffee maker is when I'll cave in and spend some money in that area..

I got this as a gift and came here on prime day to get two more and found a great bundle of two. It is just a next step in technology for your home no matter what your age is.
I love to use it while I am studying and it makes my life very easy. Let say when I am doing questions and I come across something which I need to wiki, I just ask Alexa "" wikipedia xxxxx"" and it can visually show you the page or text or read it out etc.etc etc. This is just one thing Alexa can do and having a screen is just a needed feature in today's world.

NOTE: It shows text and not the websites. As of now you can not browse the internet with ECHO as you normally would on your smartphone or iPad etc.

I revised my rating to 4 stars based on the above fact and that this does not have a rechargeable battery and needs to be kept plugged in.

Helps keep you joyful and happy specially when you are by yourself. You can spend hours just asking and playing with Alexa with your voice learning thousands of things along the way.

Can control many smart devices if you have them in your house/apt but this is right where you should start and then buy additional items as you learn the capabilities of this device. Alexa is also improving day by day.

This deal is insane right now and I just wanted to write a quick review for those who are still thinking about this. GET IT before the sale goes away....you will not regret this one (Usually amazon has deals on black Friday and prime day on these).

Have fun shopping.

Setting this up was so simply and trouble free it was a no brainer. Has all the features the my Echo Dot had and more. I love the fact that this unit hears my voice much better than the Dot did and I have it sitting on my bedroom dresser. I set it up using the ""do not disturb"" feature at night and I am still able to use the alarm and I turn it off in the morning. I have this plugged into my battery backup so if we loose power, it will still be up and running. Since I just set this up last night, I haven't tried accessing YouTube etc but because it was setup from Amazon using my account info, I didn't have to enter any info other than the WIFI password. That saved me so much time and all my WIFI smart lights and smart plug work perfectly. My daughter has the other unit but hasn't set it up as yet and I purchased another one for her out of state friend so they can chat using the Show instead of facetime on the iPhone. Haven't tried the person to person calling feature yet but I'm sure that will work fine also. Over all, I'm very happy with this product. Thank you Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am actually find the Echo Show more useful than I expected it to be.  I have several times used the Food Network and All Recipes skills to find new recipes.  One of the device's best features is its timers - specifically its ability to run simultaneous timers with different labels on each.

I find that I use the Show more than I expected.  I sometimes ask it to update me on the news or to reorder things I have bought from Amazon.  I also use the Echo to add items to my shopping list as I use the last of them.  The other feature I use more than I expected is Echo Show's Uber skill, which allows me to order an Uber car with just a voice prompt.

There are few things on my wish list for Echo Show:

An ability to forward recipes from any source to the device;

Better sound quality for listening to music;

An easy way to add multiple items to my shopping list - i.e. without needing to precede each item by saying  'Alexa';

Refinement to the Uber skill.

It’s currently 75 outside, and my screen on echo show says it’s 69. Tried changing some settings, unplugging and restarting and still no change. Rapidly becoming disappointed. Amazon, WHY can’t you FIX THIS?!?!?
Also, upon doing the upgrade, the screen no longer turns itself off, the on again when I walk into the room. Customer service tried, but they had no answer, other than "" it myst be the update"" that causes this. It's useful as a clock, with annoying little messages of things you ""can suggest"", but other than that, Alexa ""doesn't know that one"". YouTube videos are being banned according to what I have read, so forget that feature.
In my opinion, Amazon really dropped the ball on this device! Not worth the extra cash you will shell out just to have a screen that never turns off. If you go on vacation, it would be wise to UNPLUG this device, as it can get pretty warm.

I read the majority of the reviews already posted. I have no idea why there is even a one-star review.

Setup was a breeze. My Ring Pro screen pops up brilliantly. Nest cameras, too. Played Adele at the maximum volume and sang along with the lyrics Show trickled on the screen.

As far as those who boo hoo over the headlines Show displays, you can give her the voice command of DND. Problem solved. Then, just tell her to wake up.

I followed the simple instructions on how to change the generic photo on Show's home screen. Easy peasy.

Granted, I haven't made a video call yet. Waiting for my folks to get in the game and buy Show.

I'm not a lover of all things Amazon. I bought the newest Fire Tablet but returned it after a week. Show redeemed Amazon.

I purchased 2 dots and an echo during the x-mas special deals.  All the Alexa devices take time and patience.  Lots of patience to activate and figure out. I took a star away because it seems just about everything takes a “skill” to work.  Meaning Alexa needs to learn how to work said devices via a “skill.”  The software is not all that.  But what can you expect for 149 (show on sale).  I’ll tell you.

I picked up 3 shows to replace the above mentioned devices.  My family loves them.  Kids love the YouTube availability.  Thank you amazon for resolving issues with google.  That would have been a deal breaker if google wasn’t on board.

On with the review.  I can “drop in” and see what the kids are doing 2 bedrooms away.  You can visually see and communicate with another show or even an iPhone.  However,  one must use the Alexa app on the iPhone and the iPhone caller must activate the “drop in.”  I can see what’s going on outside via camera. Simply ask Alexa to “show me (insert name).”  And viola, I can see the dog via the outside (Alexa compatible) camera. No, it does not work with any camera.  Just Alexa compatible cameras at about 50 bucks a pop.  I ask Alexa to play “round and round” by Ratt.  And BAM.  Ratt on YouTube. It’s too cool. The show answers questions, makes the grocery list, adds stuff to the calendar. And on and on.  We love it.

With that said.  Most things require set up before they work.  So have someone in the family that is technically inclined to today’s technology available.  If it wasn’t for the wife, the show might have shown itself out the window.  Thank God for wives, lol.

Ending:  the show is a dream once it’s “set up.”  The set up requires lots of...., again....patience. I don’t have it, lol.  However, after the day in setting up and pairing and skills.  The show is absolutely amazing.  Get one.  But wait for a sale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
Good video chat quality.
Nice design.

Cons:
There are no physical buttons to accept / decline call. (You can do a drop-in call, but still).
Also, device is heavier than I thought.
Contacts are imported from your phone and can't be removed, weird.
Not possible to adjust energy saving settings.
Screen customization is poor, I couldn't remove all ""Alexa, what can you do?"" lines from the screen.

If you don't know this play music in stereo, unlike the hockey pucks with the 1/8 inch jack in the back, they will play two speaker mono unless you pair that with the Echo Subwoofer, that has it's own host of problems. So what is good and what is bad, OK I will do my best, first, I wish and hope that I can get voice and all the Echo/show specific features on a larger TV or monitor, it really is not realistic to watch movies or TV on it, even looking on camera would be funner on a larger monitor, which leads me to report that there is no HDMI out, nor is there 1/8 stereo out. I have not been able to find the voice activated features and the ability to simply call out songs or request weather, see lryics on another Echo product and coordinating other technology is impossible, period......
I have spoken to the Samsung Rep. And I cannot get any Echo product to assist with even the simplest of tasks, as far as my TVs are concerned, I own 4 smart 4 k TVs. So what does Echo Show do good, if you have Amazon Prime, and Prime Music unlimited, you can call out nearly any song, even remastered, limited, old songs and Echo plays it, and the sound is very good. I am going to try the subwoofer with the show, which no doubt drive me crazy, if it can even be done. This first generation Show has forward firing speakers, Second generation has side firing speakers, you will see a difference if you are sitting in front of it, not worth double the price, second generation has a larger screen since the speaker grill is located on the side and not eating up valuable space on front. If you are trying to use this in an office to assist with business, all I can say is don't, some features are not present, that you will undoubtedly need, it is what it says it is an assistant that can play almost any song, can set timers, can control smart home, and you can set many but not all preferences. Someone asked me if is worth getting the second generation? I say you can do just fine with a bargain, rather than spend double and more, (I paid 99 Dollars VS 229 Dollars) get the First Gen and save for something else, it is a good performer and sound is surprisingly good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_117?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=117&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not loud enough? Or perhaps I’m not in the mood for a particular song?  No problem! I simply call out from the shower, asking Alexia to raise the volume or move to the ‘next song’.

As an alarm it's really good.  It's really nice having a physical display so I can see the time, I don't need to ask the device what time is it.  I only watched one video, quality was better than I saw on the video reviews.

The reason the only 4 stars, well I use both Google Home and Echo products in my home, each have their purposes.  The sound quality on the Echo Show is disappointing.  For the size of the device, I was expecting richer base, but instead get this flat sounding music, using Amazon Prime Music service.  My Google Home (original model) sounds better, more rich base, music sounds full.  Good thing I didn't buy this to replace my sounds system.

Overall, for what I use it for, it's great, I would recommend the buying of it if your going to use it to replace your alarm clock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Corrie","Next","July 21, 2017","The must-have device  for any consumer who wants to talk to an inept phone tree, but cannot be bothered to call Comcast. This device is good for making calls, if by that you mean that the voice controls are ""called in."" This blurb under the text box here gives review guidlines so let's do this by the numbers:

""Do explain why you liked or disliked it:""

Alexa is Suri on about 5 fewer lead paint chips. This would not be so bad if there was a way to cut it off and start again quickly, unfortunately there are frequent times where you spend more time trying to get her to finish the wrong task she decided till you can try again, than it would to just about anything wipe off your hands, get to a computer, complete the NY Times Sunday Crossword. Then when you try again what of the mutitudes of things that might theoretically be the culpret, a fan, kid in the other room, music, Gremlins on holiday from tearing wings off airplanes. So based on such little useful information your solution is to try again after calling to the other room to quiet the kids, turn off the overhead fan, avoiding ladders and stepping on cracks and maybe.. maybe you might get a useful reply or you can truly begin to discover precisely why ""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.""

I kid you not one of the promotional materials said something like ""Alexa show me eggs"" or something like that and it comes back with nothing I had multiple people say the very line that was used as a example by Amazon's promotional materials all of us came back with nothing. Why they would have a command for ""show me eggs"". Oddly enough unlike ""Show me eggs"" which is as I said given as a example ""Alexa show me my video library"" does not seem to be a recognized command while being far more sensible... but again its not like it got the answer to the one that was listed but it seems sensible to ask a echo show but it instead gave me local listings for public libraries.

""Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you've used this product.""

For calls it loses out to cell phones, landlines, skype, and carrier pigeons. It is odd for example that in the age of everyone having their own line and family cell plans they would go with the single account=single line approach. Conceptually it seems a bit regressive but if that's the niche they can bring back the ""party line"" with the 2.0 the 3.0 they can just re-brand that carrier pigeon and call it their ""Alexa Drone."" I think that one would be hailed as the best one to date because it knows 1 command really well ""find your home"". It may crap on you like the earlier models but at least it gets the task right.

You might not have expected a full on ""Jeeves"" like experience but you will be disappointed that your digital assistant is ""Wooster"" in the first act.

""Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.""

The best thing about this Amazon product is the Amazon return policy. All product gripes aside their return process is pretty painless at least at the time of this writing.

""Don't include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.""

Even if that hat tip to their return policy qualifies on some level as ""promotion"" I think they will let it slide, but rest assured dear reader I am not being paid for this review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_295?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=295&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It reminds me every day of my schedule, it reminds me to take my pills, it keeps my shopping list, it answers all sorts of questions, and it's pretty just sitting there with the time, date, and weather.  I haven't used it yet to connect to others, but I can see this as a real 'plus' to contact out-of-town friends and relatives.

It started displaying white lines at 4 months and has progressively gotten worse. Now, where the time is displayed shows major signs of burn-in. While having video and images are nice, it’s not enough to justify the cost. (Even if it is $30 more than the echo plus).  It looks cheap and a bit trashy now and have considered just swapping it out with one of my others since it currently resides in the place everyone seems to gather.

Incredibly disappointed in the product for a handful of reasons - the main one being video playback is very limited (to Amazon Prime Video only), so attempting to play music videos is futile. I thought being an Amazon Prime member would entitle us to, at least, a music selection, but to get that service is another $7.99 a month.  The Echo's comprehension is also very limited - simple commands such as, ""Alexa, play current Top 40 music"" will have you listening to Christmas music , or prompt a response of, ""Would you like to purchase around the world in 80 days?""  I could go on with a few more frustrations, but simply, I would recommend against purchasing this device unless you're OK with very limited music and video selections - if you are thinking about purchasing the Echo, go with the Dot. It's inexpensive and just as limited as the Show.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was a smart device skeptic and have been holding off on allowing such a device in the house for awhile but this thing is incredible. We found that the show is at its best in the kitchen where you can play music, get recipes, set timers, reminders and hands free video chat. We have it connected to an Arlo security camera for outdoor monitoring but can use the Drop-in feature to check in on the house through the Shows built-in camera to see what's going on inside the house when we're away. The show becomes even better with Music Unlimited for only $4 a month. Now we can listen to 10s of millions of songs which inlcude all of the newest releases, create playlists/soundtracks and/or ask Alexa to play her own playlist like ""90s HipHop Barbecue"" and she rarely disappoints. She recognizes my kids voices and asks for parental approval before confirming their request and the kids love her. Alexa, what was the largest dinosaur? Alexa, play the Ninja Turtles song. Alexa, where is Santa now? It's pretty incredible how the kids are using her and much of the use is educational and informative. Anyways 5 stars, no doubt about it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Better than expected.","July 17, 2018","I bought this during the Prime Day deals week at $129. To be honest, if I had paid the regular price of $229, I would have been disappointed and sent it back.
The sound quality is great as is the screen view. I enjoy listening to music while fixing meals in the kitchen. It's great to be able to change songs just by voice.
Video quality is very good and I can watch my Amazon Prime videos with ease. I do NOT like that I can access my Netflix, Britbox and Hulu accounts as well, at least not as far as I've found so far.
I would love to be able to use apps instead of just Alexa Skills. I use the Paprika app for my recipes and it can't be used on the Echo Show. I also don't like having to link an account to use the other recipe apps I am interested in using. It's a pain and a bit intrusive.
I truly wish that Google and Amazon would get together about YouTube. It would be great to be able to view the videos on the Echo Show.
I'm still learning what I can and cannot do by voice. I do use the app on my iPad for the settings as it's easier than the settings on the Echo Show.
Like others, I find the constant stream of try this and try that annoying. I'm hoping Amazon will realize it's an irritation.
The screen does power down and dim when the room is darkened so I may consider moving it from my computer room to my bedroom to use for an alarm and sleep sounds.
My granddaughter was enchanted with the Moshi Sleep skill so I will be using it when she spends the night with me.
I also like using the Flash Briefing Skills. It's pretty handy when I get up in the morning. I especially like the History Flash briefing. I'm kind of a history nerd.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_120?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=120&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just as I expected I have used this on a daily bass since day one. While it hasn't replaced my other Echoes it has added a different function for me to use. It sits on my nightstand so when I can't sleep I'm able to just turn on videos and watch til I'm tired. The screen doesn't seem too bright and I hardly notice it when I'm trying to sleep.

 I also love the video calls that I'm able to make and I'm surprised at how well this worked. The video didn't lag and the voice was clear, the only issue I had was that I needed more light in order for anyone to see me, that is not a design flaw just my room is darker than I thought. Lol

The sound quality for movies and music is excellent and there's no distortion at all when you turn it loud. So far I haven't had any problems with videos lagging or anything. I did notice that when I try to play YouTube it does tell me that I have restrictions on and to turn them off in settings but I haven't found where that would be. I must be missing it somewhere but again that is my fault and not the device. I still have no problems watching the videos I want so I don't worry about it too much.

I honestly can't wait to see what will be added to this as time goes on. For me, this device is exactly what I expected and I'm very happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There is so much to say I dont know what to put in a brief review, so I will say the one main reason I bought some for Christmas gifts , I have 1 niece actually I have over a dozen .. but 1 who finally had a baby .. and my sister Mary lives out in Pine Valley  .. in the San Diego mountains and her daughter my niece who lives at the beach, and is the one who finally had a baby.. ok so I saw that Alexa can do video calls .. all I have to do is say Alexa call Lisa and she calls Lisa and I can see Lisa sitting there talking to me .. so I thought wow.. Mary needs this and Annie (my niece) so they can see the baby anytime they want .. all my sis Mary has to do is say .. Alexa call Annie and boom, Grandma Mary can see the new baby  and mommy too.. just by saying it .. didn't even have to pick up her phone, with a nice size video screen too .. that's just awesome .. So Mary and Annie got Alexa for Christmas and the Davis Family too. One funny thing is when I was telling my niece about her gift at Christmas I said you are going to have a new member in your family and they thought I got her a dog or cat ...I could see their relief as I introduced them to Alexa.  Oh Yeah one HUGE reason to have Alexa is emergencies.... seconds can save lives.. rather than finding your phone you could be telling Alexa to make the call. ....","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_126?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=126&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use it as a bedside clock/device. It controls my bedroom light & fan, it is my alarm clock, it is my sleep noise machine, and it keeps me entertained while I get ready for work in the morning. That's why I'm so disappointed that the screen has started flickering and fritzing out after less than two months. I'm used to my computers/tablets/tvs/phones lasting 3+ years. $229 for 2 months? Yikes, no. I guess I'll be testing out the warranty.

Update: Sent it in for repair. My device was returned ""fixed."" A month later and the screen is flickering again.

Easy and seamless to setup.
Stereo sound is bigger than expected, while still being very clear.
Screen is crystal clear and  the ability to touch (or  ""show"") adds a new dimension of applications.
Voice and video calling are both easy and convenient for communication in large houses.

The sound is good, I use our Dot with a Tivoli Audio radio, and this sounds comparable to that setup. The screen is somewhat useful, continually displaying time and temperature. It's a mixed blessing for recipes, as Alexa will find you a recipe for a dish but necessarily the one for which you search. We purchased ours at the sale price of $149, at $229 I might not have plumped for it. The lack of YouTube support is a big negative - I hope the giants can solve their differences.
For some reason, a multi-room setup (Group) required a firmware update that took two days to show up.
As an audiophile what I would like to see in this price range is an Alexa device with a quality DAC, so that I could run a cable into a good amp and speakers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_96?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=96&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ok I Am Upset","January 10, 2019","I have been an unbelievably huge fan of the Echo since before they even existed. I went on the preorder list and waited almost a year to get in that first run and I have been hooked ever since. The Show came out and I was showing everybody the pics of it and just always talking about it. My mom bought me one for my birthday on Dec. 8th, 2018 and I was so excited . I went home and turned it on which now made for my 5th echo in my house and the music was so much louder and it had bass and was amazing. But within about A week all the sudden I  would ask it a question and it would be offline and the light went yellow and a different echo would answer down the hall showing me the signal was there. Then after a while it would light up when I said Alexa but then it would sit there and just have the blue light blinking like it was listening but it was locked up and unless I unplugged it it would stay like that.  one time i let it go for an hour just to see and it never came back.  So I will never say I won't use my echo or i will never buy another one but when I called to see about returning it I did not get the experience I have come to know with Amazon. The lady never could understand that It wasn't  a broken device.  It was a defect straight from the start. When I put it on my dresser it never moved again. No way I hurt it. Then she said I could send it back but I had to pay the shipping or something. To be honest she was extremely difficult to understand. So here I am with probably the most excited I have been when receiving an amazon product and its a total dud. But being thats its a present I don't have the funds to ship it back and go get a box and all that. Never would have imagined I would have to. But I have a dot 3rd generation I just bought a while back and that one is awesome!

I say this because the Echo box was also damaged while the shipping box was not damaged at all.  The damage was enough that I almost shipped it back.  Seeing that the functionality was okay I decided not to go through the hassle of sending it back.  We are talking a quarter size gouge though, something they should have caught.

I've been an early adopter of Amazon Echo and have the original echo and an army of Dots.  These things are fun.  My kids ask endless questions and listen to music all day.

I couldn't be happier with the decision to order one. Sleek design and easy to set up made me happy right away. We decided to place it in the kitchen where the Echo was (moved Echo to master bedroom, moved that dot to office...). I love the display and the sound. I love the scrolling suggestions at the bottom as well. It's a little hard to remember all the commands for all that the Echo offers. Scrolling lyrics, very cool. It brings up my Nest camera's and Ring doorbell wonderfully. These are two things I was thinking may not work well but they do. Tried out the video Phone call, yep, it worked perfectly. Oh, the background images are beautiful and uploading pictures from prime photos was a breeze.

I want to give it a 5, but there is one feature that drives me nuts, so it's getting a 3.  If you look at the first couple photos of the product you'll see near the bottom of the screen [Try, ""Alexa, what's on my calendar"" or Try, ""Alexa, show lyrics""]  These tips to ""Try"" CANNOT be removed.  They rotate at whatever rate you choose and the settings, but they will never go away.  So if you think you will have this really cool piece of technology sitting on your kitchen counter with a beautiful photo of your kids, dog, lake view, etc....  Just picture Try ""Alexa, play Teen Jeopardy!!"" smack in the middle of that photo.  It's like having a constant commercial.  When emailing Amazon customer service about the issue (which having now Googled the issue can see it has been complained about since 2017) the response I received was:
I want to inform you that currently the ""Things to Try"" phrases on home screen cards can't be turned off. You can reduce how often they appear on your screen by turning off continuous card rotation or removing cards from the rotation.
I've taken it as an improvement factor and forwarded your comments as feedback to our Alexa development team. They will look into this and may come up with the best possible solutions in the nearest future. Please extend your patience and co-operation while we work on this.

That said, if that doesn't bother you, then it's a really fun device.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Update- lowered to two stars due to loss of YouTube and lack of any new features since launch. While I was initially pretty happy with this, the fact th at Amazon is having a stupid grudge match with Google affects customers negatively. One of the best uses of the show was watching you tube. Buying this at launch has only taught me one thing: don't buy any Amazon products at launch. They will ultimately lose features and be way cheaper soon enough.

Original thoughts-
 I have had an echo dot for about a year now and love it. This is basically that with a screen so I assumed it would be even more awesome.... So far.. I was right! I've only had it since launch but my first impression is well... I'm very impressed. I bought two of these, one for me and one for my mom, so she could easily do video calls with the kids. I actually think the drop-in feature is pretty cool. There is so much more I wish I could do with this, like use it as a surveillance device (which may be possible? Likely if it isn't it will be in the future) I have lots of smart devices and being able to control them via Alexa is in general pretty cool.
One complaint I do have is when using this with my Arlo cameras, it is a bit slow to show them and sometimes they don't come up and I have to ask again. (This could also be an Arlo issue not Alexa, not sure)
Bottom line, this is a really cool device. I am sure you could nit-pick the crap out of some things, but really there isn't any other device that does what this does all-in-one so it does what it does better than anything else available.
(oh... I wish I could have Alexa ignore my 4 year old. LOL)","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_169?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=169&reviewerType=all_reviews"

In order for my in-laws to talk with each other it involved having the nurses bring a phone to my SILL, make the call and hold the phone while my SIL to speak to her mom. My MIL does not drive and lives 14 miles from her daughter, I live 2 hours from both. For my MIL-she had to call the nursing station and get someone to take the phone to my SIL.  I purchased each a cheap cell phone to get them a cell phone #. I keep the phones (they do not have to stay charged to work).  My SIL runs through the nursing home WiFI, my MIL runs through the assisted living WiFi. Having the Echos where they can ""facetime"" each other every night has made a tremendous difference in their lives.  My SIL can ""call"" me on my Alexa app. I have an account set up for my SIL to watch movies, request books (she can't hold the books) and to listen to music.  It has given her a lot more independence when she is in the bed and consequently reduced her anxiety level. I also have the ability to ""drop-in"" on her.  The nursing home has used ""super"" Velcro to attach the Echo to the wall by my SIL's bed so that it is at the correct angle.  I would highly recommend it for elderly who don't operate cell phones easily so that they can ""face time"" with family members through the app.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_143?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=143&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 I get something out of him having it too  (besides the joy of seeing him enjoy something so much!)...piece of mind as I can check in on him to make sure he is okay.
He's making use of other aspects of Alexa as well due to the on screen prompts. He loves playing ""his"" music. All he has to do is ask.

The screen keeps flashing all this useless information, (“ Serena Williams to play Roger Federer!!!!” ~ So what?!)  and I don’t know how to turn it off. It also keeps running stuff like, “Ask me a question”.  I don’t need to ask her a question. I can ask my phone or use my iPad for that. I don’t play music, I can’t watch tv on it, It’s just a bunch of crap I don’t care about. What does it do? I Guess I just don’t get it. My kids keep telling me, “ Mom, play around with it.

Here's why,  Its nice to see calendar events on the screen instead of having to ask for them, and the weather ends with a display of the week, nice.  Still waiting for radar weather maps though.  Playing my songs with lyrics is pretty good deal too, and I don't have to ask who the artist is, I can just glance over at the screen.  The best feature is the always-on screen with tidbits of news stories which reminds me that Alexa is right there for me.  When its just a black tube, sometimes you forget it's there and don't use it as much.  Alexa is the same quality, quickness, thoroughness, and can hear just as well (which is VERY good!) however, it does not have 360 degree speakers so sounds perfect from the front, but not as good from the back--not enough to cut it  a star, but was kinda of used to the echo sound from before.  I don't use the drop-in feature much, only to annoy my dog--but it works great.

It has so many features, can connect by wi-fi or Bluetooth. The ap is a little confusing to use on my iPhone, but that’s probably just me. Have only been using iPhone for a few months and don’t find it as user friendly as the android phones and tablets I’ve used before.
I would have given 5 stars, but decided not to yet since I just got it. Also, you used to be able to watch Netflix on them but they’ve taken that away.

The sound does provide a bit more bass...but I am a bit disappointed in the fact that the unit does not provide a ""constant"" screen visual of what you are listening to (e.g., news reports).  In fact, only a few broadcast systems or news reports offer any related visuals....and those that do are very limited in length before the screen turns off.  As a kitchen area device, I was hoping for a visual unit to coincide in full length with the verbal aspects of the Alexa/Echo platform.

One irritable note:  This unit has demonstrated (over time) that it fails to receive verbal commands when it is in playing mode.  I think this may have to do with the deeper bass associated with the speaker system.  It does not easily capture lower voice tone commands.  So, unless this item is positioned in the complete open (void of walls or household items) then voice commands will have to be repeated to carry out commands!  This was not an issue with the original Alexa/Echo units.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After that all is good. Looks like everyone is still learning. The only problem is the speakers are still as bad as the ones in the original Alexa.

I already had two of the echo and one dot first generation but this Show is so awesome. I'm still learning what all it can do. You can do face time calls from the show and watch movies and so much more. I purchased the echo connect and hooked my phone up to the devices. When I want to make a call or send a text I just tell Alexa to do it. I also connected all of the lights in my house and the thermostat. Now Alexa turns the lights on and off. One little word of advice: don't buy the Emerson thermostat. The Sensi app is terrible and won't connect to the internet for me and reading the reviews it seems to be a common problem with it. I'm waiting for a new thermostat to arrive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It works great with all of them. I like the ability to see who's at my front door with the ring doorbell. Only takes a few seconds to show up on screen. Works good with my Arlo cameras also, but it takes a few seconds longer to pull those up. Does everything my Echo Dots do but better. Speaker sounds great too. Much better than I thought it would be. They just updated these things so now you can have multi room audio!! That is a big plus. I've been waiting a long time for them to do this, and it works flawlessly. I have 3 Echo Shows and 5 Echo Dots and now I can hear my music in almost every room of my house, or just a few rooms if I choose. You can set up multi room audio and create rooms you want to listen to music in and the just tell Alexa to listen to ""artist/song/playlist"" downstairs/everywhere or whatever rooms you set up. Best thing to happen to all of the Echo lineup. Thank you Amazon for this update. Going to buy a couple more Echo Shows for other rooms of my house now. And the drop in feature is great too. No more yelling upstairs at my wife to bring something down with her. Just drop in and ask her now.

I contacted amazon customer service techs, and the rep kept me on the phone for over 76 minutes “troubleshooting”. He made me go through the same restart steps over and over again. He then contacted Hulu on a 3rd party call, insisting that my sub service must be restricted (despite the fact that I have 3 additional echo show devices in my home that play my Hulu perfectly) Hulu confirms my sub wasn’t an issue, and then the amazon rep suggested I return the device and allow their tech team to “service” the unit. (2 week wait on that) I literally just bought and received the device two days prior to this issue...but the rep insisted that my warranty expired over a year ago and he could not accept a return. What?! How did he not know after being on the phone with me for over 75 minutes and having all my order history in front of him, that this device was purchased just days before the call?? All of my amazon devices are less than 2 months old! Long story short, he finally came to the conclusion that amazon sold me this unit from their return center without it being serviced from defects that prompted previous owner to return. He advised that it’s basically a hit or miss with the warehouse, and sometimes the defective units slip through the cracks. After over an hour of my time and no viable solution, he then approves a return (which should have been done within the first 2 minutes of my phone call). I ask for an exchange for a working unit and he tells me that I must wait a week to be refunded and then reorder again. It was an epic customer service FAIL. Time is precious, and for most of us, time is money. The most logical approach to this situation would have been a simple exchange/return. Why should I have to wait for amazon to receive the confirmed defective device first? Did they suspect I would try to keep both devices, despite one being non functional? Ultimately, these Alexa devices cannot be used without amazons approval, so I really don’t understand their logic. Solid, reliable Customer service is more  important to me than even the price of the product I’m purchasing. I am spending thousands per year on amazon purchases and memberships and Alexa devices- at minimum, I would expect amazon to be capable of resolving issues like this without burdening me as the customer, and making me jump through hoops. Their overall customer service has become cold and not at all reliable. I no longer purchase from amazon with confidence, and am considering scaling back on memberships and purchasing all of my “convenience items” from them. It’s just not worth the hassle of losing hours of time and weeks for a refund/exchange- it’s simply dreadful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_67?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=67&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player At first, I was the biggest fan.  I ordered two; one for each of my homes so I could drop in to double check the Nest Cam movement notifications. So again, at first, the Echo Show was great.  The speaker is more along the lines of the quality of the original Echo- much different than the Echo Look and the Echo Dot. The screen was gorgeous. It was just novel and neat.... that was in January.

Fast forward to April... my screen starts flickering on one of the devices... I wait on that for a few days then am annoyed, so I make a help inquiry on the Alexa app and am told it's a software issue that has been resolved.  Great, that was April 20th.  We look good for a while.  I wish I had the records on that so I knew how long the ""fix"" lasted... because the flickering came back with a vengeance... on both devices.

So I make another help inquiry via the Alexa app on May 5th. I get an email response telling me to call customer service... which is the last thing I wanted to do.  So I put it off for weeks because I figured the answer would just annoy me... I waited until May 20th actually... and I wish I would have never called. When I told the representative the screen on both of my Show devices was flickering, their response was ""It's an issue on our end. The higher ups in technology are working on it. We will let you know when it's fixed.""  I just hung up the phone.... I got these devices on sale (which now they seem to be on sale all the time?), if I had paid full price, I would be even more annoyed.

If you're looking for an Echo device that's fine for listening to music but has a different form factor than the traditional Echo, go for it...  Even the drop is feature is fine; the camera works on the device even when the screen is flickering- which was great to check on the house at 1:30 am when there was an notification the garage door was opened and no one was at the house...  If you want a reliable device to actually show you an image... wait or order it and wait for the disappointment.

**July update... logged into Amazon to make a new complaint as I've been waiting 3 months for a fix.  Noticed that the item was eligible for return... So as of July 11th, 2018 my return has been processed and these neat annoyances will be out of my life until I am certain that there is no software issue... because taking the software release back to April would have clearly been too much work for Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased this as a gift for my mother in the US.  Overall, I have to say I'm very impressed.  This is much better than any echo product available in Canada.  But setting it up for her was a pain in the neck...

This is well beyond her abilities to set-up, as she doesn't even own a smart phone.  We had her try a smart phone, but she could not read the screen clearly enough to use it.  So instead I had this mailed to my sister that set it up for her.  Then she received it when visiting for Christmas.  Overall, it worked well at my sisters house.  The problem became later when she got home.  Because my sister had set up the echo with her phone, it thought she was still at my sisters house.  It seems there is no way for someone to remotely update the configuration, short of a VPN tunnel on their phone.  I next time I visit I will need to correct her settings, until then it is not working correctly when I call her, because it will ring my sister's house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews"

2) To Do List - ""Alexa, make me a to do list.""  ""Alexa, add clean car to my to do list.""
3) Adding products in my Amazon Prime account to my shopping cart.
4) Playing music.
5) Reminders - ""Alexa, remind me tomorrow at 10am to wash the car.""
6) Calendar Events - ""Alexa, make an appointment on Tuesday at 12pm.  Lunch with Kora.""
7) Alarm Clock - ""Alexa, set an alarm for 6:15am, Monday through Friday.""  By the way, the screen will go dark after the lights are out and will dimly display the time just as an alarm clock would.
8) Timer - ""Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes.""
9) Weather Forcast - ""Alexa, what is the Forcast for today?""
10) Math - ""Alexa, what is 127 plus 534 minus 12 plus 82 divided by 3 times 12 squared?""
11) Playing movies
12) Looking up a recipe.

1. It would be nice to use at least a few features while not being connected to the Wi-Fi instead of nothing at all. Like the calender, timer, current reminders, making list, & setting an alarm if using it at the bed side. We don't always have it connected because it hogs the Wi-Fi even with 100mb.

2. Wish it had a optional built in calender instead of having to load a personal one. But having my personal gmail, it sends reminders to my phone.

I might be missing a few things but other than that we really enjoy it. The speaker sounds great, it runs smooth and some of the skills you can add are nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have only had it for a week but I am left wondering ... WHY?  Why is the Echo Show and what does it bring to the table?  It is not better than my Echo.

Where does the Echo Show fit into my home?  It does not support YouTube so placing it in the kitchen to watch how-to cooking videos is out.  I could replace my clock by my nightstand with the Echo Show but the speakers are not powerful enough to project into the bathroom while I shower.  The little bastard also does not pair well with my iPhone.  If I am listening to a podcast or Audible and get a text or email the subsequent notification *bing* stops the streaming.  Silence follows.  And it will not accept my phone number in SETUP so I cannot initiate or receive calls.

Now, I CAN listen to music and watch the lyrics slowly scroll on the screen.  Totally worth $279, right?

Nope!

Note also that there is an annoying flash announcement on the screen.  I have no idea why it drives me crazy but it does.
- A BOY DOES NOT GET SPECIAL SAUCE ON HIS BIG MAC.  Ask Alexa, ""Alexa, tell me about the boy and his Big Mac.
- A KANGAROO DRIVES A CAR IN DOWNTOWN DETROIT.  Ask Alexa, ""Alexa, tell me about the driving kangaroo.""

Unfortunately you cannot customize the screen except for a background photo.  Otherwise, you see what Bezos wants you to see.

Do not get me wrong.  I love my Kindle and my Amazon Prime account and I could not live without Alexa.  I have setup a smart home via my SmartThings hub with several Echos and I am in heaven.  I just have no idea why anyone should spend $279 on an Echo Show.  And, hey, why was I so excited that I bought two?

But maybe I am just missing the point?  *scratches head*","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_247?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=247&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Like a similar interface to FireTV. The Show was hard to get used to but quickly pays off after learning how to get/find what you want. Example: if you do a search it uses Bing and shows you tabs of search results. Searching the entire web and you get flash card results...seems rudimentary at best. But behind those cards, I know there is a lot of opportunity for updates. I mounted this thing to my elliptical to make my work out experience a breeze so I could push less (iPad) and talk more to get shows and content. You can Bluetooth your iPhone and play podcasts over the speakers, it is great!

I will try to see if Amazon will replace it but because the new model is now out I don't know if they will.  Besides I would rather have the new model.  Not sure if they would give me much of a trade in on my old one, as it don't work properly anymore.  Besides the defect with the screen during the warranty period, this product has been great.

- listening to music: the speakers are amazing, and amazon music has an incredible selection
- looking up recipes: just ask alexa for a recipe that you'd like to make, and she brings up a great selection
- doing the dishes: when you're in the kitchen doing the dishes and want to switch the song, it's as easy as asking alexa to play the next song, or turn up/down the volume without getting your wet hands all over it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Need a way to have it list all enabled skills.  Yes, I could use a web browser on my PC to check the skills, but why can't the ES display them?  That would make it a lot easier to remember the names of the skills and launch them.  2. Need a way to create my own launch words for skills that are too awkward to speak.  3. I really don't like the device grabbing my contact list from my cell phone and then using it as the device contact directory.  I would prefer to choose to whom I want to link.  I probably don't want my boss's contact info posted in the device and I really don't want to video conf with his home.  4. It would be nice to have a speed dial list of the preferred contacts, and choose which of these should have drop in ability. My primary example is that I use this device to video webex with my 97 year old father in law.  It works great as long as I initiate the call.

Just a quick review.  I have a regular Echo that my son gave me.  It's not lovable, but it has some uses.  When he gave me the Echo Show, I was puzzled.  What can this new one do the other can't?  For one thing it gets confused w/ the other one and they both respond.  I changed the wake word.  That fixed that.

And, the Echo Show shows photos which I really like.

Now here's the problem.  Neither use anything past some really good programming.  AI?  I don't think so.  Neither could puzzle their way around a corner.

And! when you go to look at your photos on Echo Show THERE IS ALWAYS AN AD.  It's not occasional, it's always there and according to the FAQ you can't turn them off.  It destroys the value of being able to look at anything on the screen because their add is ALWAYS there on top of whatever you're looking at.

The only complaints I have is that it sits with a slight tilt upwards, which means that you have to be sitting slightly above it for the camera to be centered on you.  And, you have to be within about three feet for the person on the other end to see any great detail of your face.  But, since it has somewhat of a wide view lens, you can ""drop in"" on it with your phone or another echo show and pretty much seen the entire room.  It also doesn't seem to respond to any other requests or commands if you are online talking or video conferencing someone.

I'm writing this review after using Alexa Echo Show for about a week. I think this product is highly under-rated based on over all functionality it offers. It can pretty much do everything that you expect Echo/Alexa to do for you. I think where this product gains significant advantage is 7 inch screen which turns into home entertainment or automation or security hub while not sacrificing sound quality.

What I like Most?
-  Ask Alexa to show me who is at the front door and it will connect to my nestcam.
-  Ask Alexa to provide me video news briefing and start playing CNN videos.
-  Ask Alexa to play YouTube :) (yes its back!! wo hoo) Only draw back is I cant ask Alexa yet to play my playlist on YouTube but hopefully it can be fixed in future updates.
-  Ask Alexa to play Amazon Video
- Ask Alexa to make video calls -- Pay Slide Show - Check Weather - Set thermostat - Turn off Lights, Play songs all with VISUAL Experience and Digital Dolby sound!!

so, my recommendation - Skip Regular Echo and BUY Echo Show. It offer significantly higher value in the package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_393?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=393&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's fun to listen to music and have the lyrics scroll by for a sing-a-long. We also use it for a running shopping list, door locks and porch lights; and enjoy the silly jokes and limericks.  It took a couple days to figure out how to set it up for our different family accounts, so that we could listen to each other's music, and the Amazon help line was completely baffled. However, I figured it out myself, mostly just by searching around on the site and trying out different things. Instructions could be much clearer for sharing accounts within a family household.

I was initially eyeing on the Spot, but when the Show was selling at the same price as the Spot (plus a bigger screen), it was a no brainer which of the two to buy.
There’s so many features this device can do, but I’ve mostly been using the “drop in” feature to check in on my household, and I like it’s audio/visual clarity than my wireless cam.  Yes, I’ve read a lot of the pros/cons, but for the most part, I’m very happy with it that I actually bought a 2nd one for the kitchen, which I think will see more use.

UPDATE 12/18:

It’s been 6 months since I’ve bought the Show.  I know theres a lot more features it can do, but as an “average” user, I must say... VERY SATISFIED!  I have one in the kitchen and living room.  I typically use it to listen to music and I must say, as an audiophile, the speaker output is more than sufficient.  It belts out good, robust solid sound unlike smaller Bluetooth speakers.  I don’t know how well this works in modern homes with open cathedral rooms though, but I know I’ve had to ask Alexa to turn the music down on a few occasions!  Other than that, it’s very convenient asking Alexa what the sports scores are for out-of-market teams, setting timers during cooking, weather...etc.  I’ve actually ordered my 3rd Show that’s going to replace my alarm clock.  Definitely looking forward to using that!

CAMERA ISSUES FIXED.  When I got the Show, I had problems with the camera turning on after initial set up.  After much troubleshooting (even contacted Amazon support which they didn’t reply), I found the solution after scouring the net: after initial set up (when the device downloads new updates) and is at the normal home screen, shut the device off and turn it back on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_50?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=50&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would appreciate if I could use it as a front-end graphical interface to Amazon Music or Amazon Video, so that it does not completely rely on Voice Recognition, or on requesting stuff through the mobile phone.
For English names Alexa works great, however I simply cannot ask for any International singer/band since Alexa always tries to match it to English language.
A GUI would definetely help on this limitation.
AI needs a lot of improvement yet.
Sometimes Alexa do not even understand about a request related to a story that she ""advertised"" 30 seconds ago. If you do not ask for more information about ""stories"" right away, it is not likely to understand when asked for more information about it.
Podcasts reading would be great!
Better integration to Google devices would be also great!
Other than that, once I was able to adjust the equalizer, audio quality got quite reasonable.
For North American singers and bands, Amazon Music integration to Alexa works just great. The capability of shuffling songs from specific periods is also great. Ex: Alexa play 90s rock songs, etc
Ring integration works fine.
Drop in and video calls are great!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_168?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=168&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And it says it can’t play video when I ask it to. It tries to load YouTube and it can’t. I read on the Internet that Google cut off access. Googles mantra used to be “do no evil” but this is a petty act that deprives users access to open user posted content. So the device is not of much value if it can’t play video when asked.

Also, it advertises the ability to video call. But I only found out that you need to setup a mobile number with your amazon account for it to get the contacts you can video dial. This doesn’t work for my parents with an older phone. And besides, why can’t you simply add the contacts you want to video dial directly into the Alexa app and optionally link with your phone contacts? Doesn’t make any sense. And is only discovered after you buy the device.

I currently own the original Echo and an Echo Dot and absolutely love them both.

The Echo Show arrived nicely packaged and my first impression is that it is a clean looking design and a bit smaller than I had pictured in my mind, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it looks great on my counter top. It is EXTREMELY easy to set up due to the touch screen. No need to consult the Alexa app. I only needed to know the name of my Wifi, wifi password and Amazon password. This was a truly simple process and the touch screen walks you through it. It needed to update before starting, which I found odd since it was literally released today, but it only took a few minutes and we were up and running. I guess this is just an example of how Amazon is constantly updating and improving these devices.

The home screen displays the time and I set it up to scroll through family pictures which I really enjoy. If you own a Kindle Fire, this has a similar pull down from the top menu to give access to your settings.

I began asking Alexa questions immediately. ""Alexa, how old is Tom Brady?"" I got a nice picture of the golden boy along with his age which is definitely a plus. The questions are answered aloud as well as with text on the screen. You can set up a Flash Briefing using the Alexa App on your phone to tell you the news whenever you ask. CNN provided a nice video with their news which was really cool, but NPR and Wall Street Journal just had audio. I was a bit disappointed that the majority of the skills I tried did not utilize the screen. I think that just like the original Echo, this will improve with time. These are skills (apps) so it is just a matter of the skill updating to adjust to the new technology. Amazon is also great at listening to feedback and adding more features all the time. Echo Show is able to list movie times and even show movie trailers on the screen. The picture quality is very good. I also ask sports questions and the team logo, scores and information are displayed on the screen along with the answer to my question. I'm a big college sports fan and I love asking when the next game is or the score of the last game. This is a great feature.

Now, what I use my Echo for the most...playing music. I am an Amazon Prime member so have access to the Prime music library. You can also use Pandora, Sirius, Spotify, Iheart radio and TuneIn. ""Alexa, play Zach Brown Band.""  I am amazed at the rich, full sound that fills the large kitchen/family and dining room in our open floor plan house. I am not an expert on speakers but the sound is definitely better than the original Echo which I still very much enjoy. The screen shows the lyrics so feel free to sing along!

One thing that I find myself saying over and over is ""Alexa go home."" This seems to be the easiest way to close a skill or video and return to your home screen. You can also scroll down from the top of the screen to get your settings bar and touch the home button.

YouTube is the bomb on this device. It is fully functional and will prove to be both entertaining and educational. I love this feature. ""Alexa, show me a YouTube video on dog training."" Boom! I have many choices available to me on the screen.  ""Alexa, play number 2."" Now, if I could only get Alexa to train my dog to stop putting her front paws up on the kitchen counter...I also tried the Ted Talks app and that provided audio only.

Echo Show reads Audible books very well, the same as the original Echo but with the better speakers. There is not much benefit to having a screen for this, but I listen to Audible a lot while working in the kitchen or making dinner.

I tested the Amazon video capabilities and was very pleased with its ability to provide that content. Since I have it on the kitchen counter, i don't plan to watch movies on the Echo Show, but certainly could if I wanted. I can unplug it and move it anywhere I would like and it quickly connects itself to Wifi once plugged in again.

I looked up a recipe on the AllRecipe skill and was pleased that it showed a picture of the dish and written ingredient list along with directions on the screen. This will be quite helpful. When I played music at the same time I was looking at the recipe, it would go back to the music lyric screen after a few minutes. I would have preferred it to stay on my recipe. I will need to explore this further. It could be user error. The Campbells recipe skill does not currently provide any content on the Echo screen but sends the recipe via email to another device. I would think this can/should be improved.

If you have a timer set, it is displayed on the screen. This also reverts back to the lyric screen if you are playing music, but I don't mind that as you can always ask, ""Alexa, how much time is left?"" and she will tell you. I just love her! The timer still goes off even with the music on.

I have had this less than 24 hours but am really enjoying it. It is more user friendly than the original Echo because it is continually providing help and information on the touch screen. Even if you are technically challenged, you should be able to use this.

All of the Echo devices are great for running smart home devices, but I don't currently use it for that, so can't really help you there.

You can also make video calls with this, which I have not yet tried. I'm usually walking around and doing other things while talking on the phone so probably won't use this feature much. It would be great if you had children or grandchildren you wanted to see when you were out of town.

In my opinion, the Echo Show is a helpful, innovative and fun gadget to own. It needs to improve a bit to fully utilize the display screen which I believe it will with time. If you currently do not have any Echo devices, then this is the one to get. If you are a bit uncomfortable with technology, then this would be a good device for you because Amazon provides so much support via the touch screen. If you already own the original Echo, you may or may not want to purchase this right now. I have not found it to be worlds better than my original Echo at this point. If you would use the video chat or are wanting a richer sound for music, then I recommend purchasing the Echo Show. I do enjoy now having an Echo in the kitchen/main part of the house and in the bedroom. I am hoping that, like the original Echo, the content will continue to improve with time, but I am very happy with my purchase of the Echo Show. I hope this helped you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_186?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=186&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(I usually have trouble with these kinds of things.)

Like over reviewers, I wish I could eliminate the annoying ""Try Alexa..."" running at the bottom of the screen.  It would also be nice if I could turn off the default 5 minute "" ""sleep mode"" when listening to music.  (When listing to music/viewing lyrics, it should automatically turn off.

I bought it specifically for the drop in feature, and it didn't disappoint. I also like the fact that it links to your Spotify account. You can tell it to play a certain playlist you've created, and it will do it. It also allows you to shuffle songs.

However, Alexa simply is not a very good A.I. - it understands you just fine, for the most part, but it doesn't do a very good job at what it's designed to do. For example, I asked it who Captain America is. Instead of giving me the answer, it tells me to follow someone who provides that information. But that guy sucks so there is pretty much no way to get that information. I also asked it to tell a bedtime story, and it gave me some nonsense about having to sign up for a skill set or something. And other times, it simply doesn't know anything at all. The most common thing I hear is something along the lines of ""hmm I'm not sure.""

My only other experience with an A.I. is the one that starts with a G. And when you compare Alexa to that, it really stands out as an inferior system. The G one will be coming out with their own video version soon. Unless you are loyal to Amazon or have accounts linked to it, you'd be better off waiting for that device.

Besides that the show is a great device and if the lyrics issue is fixed I will probably buy one or two more for different rooms in the house. The Show has great video replay and the speakers are excellent. Love being able to watch Amazon movies on my nightstand while I'm writing or getting ready for bed. One other feature the Show could use is a remote control, sometime while in the closet the Show can't hear my requests and a remote would help and not make me scream.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_155?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=155&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I have an iPhone that has Siri and I also have a smart TV. I don’t do anything to worry about people spying anyway. But I decided to go ahead and get the Alexa Show – I am absolutely enthralled by it. My whole family is. It was easy to set up. It’s pretty easy to use the app – you can add so many skills to add to the usefulness of it. I wish I would’ve bought one sooner. It’s so nice to be able to lay in bed and have Alexa turn off my light, my fan and other stuff around the house- LOVE that the start bulbs can dim your lights or change color if you bought those kinds. I just remodeled and had all new dimming lights put in/ what a waste of money!

Hoping my kids will be brave enough to put one in their household so we can drop in on each other through Alexa.

One thing I didn’t know when I was buying smart switches, bulbs, plugs and other smart items – is that I bought them from seven different companies so I ended up having to download seven different apps and create accounts for each one to connect to Alexa! Just a word of warning do some research and look at reviews of which ones are best and stick with one or two brands. I wish I would’ve known that before hand. Anyway really love my Alexa show, I bought one that came with an echo. I can’t imagine having just an echo without a screen. Really enjoy having the screen to interact with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Echo Spot sits on my kitchen counter, about 6 feet from my Kloss Model one FM radio which plays NPR all day. Probably once or twice a day the Spot wakes up and may start chattering gibberish as a result of hearing something resembling its wake word.

I have downloaded the alexa.app on my iPhone and I have also checked the settings on the device itself. It has my correct street address, city, state and zip code in both places. It knows I am an Amazon Prime member yet if I ask it for my location, Alexa tells me that I am 125 km away from my actual house! If I ask for the weather, it gives me outdoor temperatures that are typically 5-8 degrees warmer than actual, probably miles inland from my coastal location (and what the Accuweather website says!). Ask for movies playing at local cinemas? - she cannot do it. She cannot find any local theaters. Ask for local restaurants ? yes!! She can even give me the address and tell me one is 1.5 miles away.
Where is the nearest Whole Foods Market - yes, 1.7 miles away.  Where is the nearest CVS drug store (next door to Whole Foods!) - sorry, I don't know that. ....... Just total inconsistency.

So far, the best use I have found for my Echo Show is to ask it to play BBC Radio 4. It can do that almost as well as my Grace Digital Radio!

Until Amazon makes major improvements to Alexa's intelligence, I would definitely not recommend spending close to $200 on this gadget.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
Sound Quality
Large Screen
Ability to display CloudCam streams
Access to Prime Videos (if you like watching on a 7"" screen)
Very easy setup

Cons:
Ability to only display one camera feed at a time. The ability to split screen would be a great improvement.
Screen can be under-utilized
UI can be difficult to navigate.

The result is that the Echo Show has apparently been intentionally de-platformed by YouTube, and it therefore cannot, at the time of this review, be used to view any YouTube content.  This is a shame, because this sweet little device is nearly perfect for researching the wealth of cooking and other short topic videos on YouTube.  While it does have access to many other sources of video content - it just isn't a candidate for viewing movies if a larger screen is available.  The lack of YouTube is utterly perplexing, and frustrating.

That said -- the Echo Show is a marvelous bit of technology for entertainment, communication, automation, topical research, information about the weather, and traffic information among other things.  I use mine to control numerous smart lights, thermostat, and to safely peer out at the world through our Ring Doorbell Pro.  Using Tunein it becomes a crystal clear radio, and the Serius XM streaming app/talent allows it to play satellite radio.  The Alexa app allows it to make audio or video calls to those who have registered with the Alexa App and have one of the Alexa enable devices themselves.

The new drop-in capability allows the Echo Show to behave like a web/WIFI camera with two way audio, and it allows audio-only Alexa enabled devices to act like a full duplex intercom system.  To use the Echo Show as a camera in this way, simply enable the drop-in privilege for yourself on your own Echo Show, and then drop-in using the Alexa app from your Android or iOS compatible device.  The connection is announced at the Echo Show with some tones, and then a fuzzy picture slowly resolves into a full resolution video that displays what the Show's camera sees.  The video isn't recorded as it would be with some web-enabled cameras -  but it is a great way to check in on your house when you are away.  You can even talk to your pets and hear what is happening at their location.  Drop-in can be limited to only those devices designated as ""within the household"", or it can be extended or prohibited on a case by case bases for select contacts.  A number of senarios make the ability for unilateral initiation of a connection a valuable feature; if you can't think of any you probably shouldn't enable the feature.  Where the feature is enabled it should be expected that those who have been authorized to establish a connection will do so at any time allowed.  This feature can be schedule limited.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_201?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=201&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Overall I am happy with it.  Especially the business account pricing.  For anyone not knowing about business pricing convert your account to a business account easily and see the money you can save.  This Echo Show is regular price 115.00 all the time.  Awesome!  I saved 125 or more dollars.  but disappointed a little in the quality of the mic and Alexa picking up the commands.  It replaced the original Alexa 1st edition (tall cylindar unit without a screen) which sounds and reacts to commands almost every single time rarely without a problem.  The unit does not allow connecting to a 5.0 ghz network band only 2.4.  The unit has disconnected by itself several times while the other 7 echo or alexa devices remained online.  On the positive side the brightness of the screen and the playback of Prime Videos or News Flash updates is incredible!  The camera  when dropping in from your mobile device to check on your dogs or friend or family is TOP NOTCH and quality is 100%.  Overall I have decided to keep the unit hoping that a firmware update soon to come will address the wireless issue and speech detection.  I would recommend this to anyone.

When the Echo Show first came out, I was excited about the possibilities, but a screen didn't appeal to me as I was mostly focused on finding an easy way to play music throughout our house, and the original Echo speaker worked great for that. I originally chose the Echo because I want quality sound but I don't need anything that anyone would consider hi-fi, so I didn't want to invest in a more expensive ecosystem like Sonos or Bose (plus, at the time, Sonos didn't have a speaker with Alexa yet). I just wanted background music for the bedroom when getting ready, in the living room when hanging out, and in the kitchen when cooking and eating, so I invested in a Dot and a few Echoes (I have several of both the original Echo and the 2017 2nd generation Echo). I've been really happy with all of these speakers.

However, as I've invested more in the Echo ecosystem, I've also started to incorporate more smart home products, especially wifi outlet switches. While those don't benefit from a screen, I've become increasingly interested in getting a smart thermostat and wifi cameras as well. So, when the Show went on sale for $179.99 on Black Friday (plus just $5 more for a TP-Link Mini Smart Plug) at Best Buy, I went and picked one up (it was the first time I've ever bought an Echo device from any place other than Amazon, and it didn't affect set-up or anything at all).

Here's why I give this 5 stars:
+ The setup was the easiest of all the Echo products I own because you set it up using it's own screen instead of the app of the phone.
+ The screen is vivid and clear, perfect for watching videos in casual circumstances and for seeing song lyrics, which my wife enjoys.
+ The sound is much more crisp, clear, and full sounding than any of my other Echoes (my Dot is hooked up to a Klipsch 2.1 Promedia system, so it technically sounds better, but honestly, for 90% of my listening, I'd actually prefer the all-in-one Show). Before I got the Show, I was pairing 2 standard Echoes in my bedroom for a fuller sound, but I've found that the Show is enough for our bedroom (the Show isn't equal to the 2 paired Echoes, but it's good enough to stand alone). I actually think the sound for the type of music I listen to most (modern, acoustic, mellow folk and indie) is really quite good. The quality also stays much better than my other Echo speakers when played at higher volumes, too.
+ The user interface is pretty simple and intuitive
+ The screen adds a dimension that the other Echoes cannot (lyrics, display time and temperature, showing suggestions and ways to engage with it) that I have appreciated. I may grow tired of the suggestions, but the preferences will allow you to limit some of that. Also, simple things that I commonly do with my Echoes is just better with a screen (for example, some parts of my Flash Briefing now have video and weather forecasts are easier for me to digest when I see them [likewise when I ask about what's on my calendar]).

The only drawback I've found with the hardware itself is that it's not built onto a rotating platform or one that can change the angle at which the show sits. Third parties have made bases for the Show, but ones that do all of that aren't exactly cheap, and I haven't yet justified spending the extra money.

While I give the Show 5 stars, there are a few things I hope that Amazon and third parties will add to improve the overall experience:
- Add more video flash briefing content (especially content that was originally video, such as the Daily Show and late-night monologues).
- Create some sort of a night mode that keeps the screen off except when I want to see the time (perhaps a tap to bring the screen on as it does now, but then include a way to  easily turn the screen back off without saying, ""Alexa, turn off the screen,"" such as another tap or simply have a setting for it to turn completely off again after 5-10 seconds. [***Update 12/8/17: This actually is a feature -- it just takes two steps: all you have to do is go to Settings -> Display and toggle off the Ambient Clock. Then, turn the Echo's Do Not Disturb Mode on. It will now default to having the screen off, and it will turn on for only a short time as you interact with it (which can be through touch, so you don't wake anyone up if you just want to see the time in the middle of the night). Now I think the Echo Show is the perfect bedside replacement for an alarm clock.***]
- Allow alarms to be set to play a music playlist instead of an alarm sound. [***Update 12/12/17: Thanks to a new update on 12/11/17, this is an option!***]
- More generally, and I'm not sure if this is possible because of the way Amazon is using Bluetooth to create multi-room audio groups, I'd like to see multi-room music become more flexible (speakers could belong to more than one group or groups could be nested together under a larger group). I'd also like to be able to 'move' music (such as a playlist I'm currently playing) from one group to another (like when I leave my bedroom to go down to the living room) without having to start the playlist over.

Overall, I highly recommend this Echo. I think it is by far the best of all my Echo devices (though they are all great, too!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They don't sound quite as good as the regular old Beta version of the Echo it replaced.  But the screen makes several things nicer to do.  I want to disable all of the ""Try Alexa this"" messages on the front, because my kid tries them all.

Some of them I don't want her to try.  I wish I could have the Calendar scheduled to be up every morning at 7am as we hit the kitchen, so that I don't have to remember to check it on hectic days, it's already available.

As an alarm clock, I believe it is lacking. It has the 3 buttons on the top, and I had hoped one of them would of let me turn the alarm off.  They do not, the only way to stop the alarm is to swipe up on the screen, but if you accidentally tap the screen you turn it to snooze. The screen still has a lot of backlight at night, making it brighter than I want.

Turns out it needed a software update.","July 7, 2018","I just finally decided to break down and get the Echo Show as it was 100 dollars off and I have many other Amazon Dots and Echos. I can tell you this they must not be selling well because mine was not working very well when I first got it. It would not pull up recipes even though it would say here is what I found. It would try to show me videos using YouTube (this was exciting for a second as I know Amazon and Google are fighting so YouTube is not allowed on Amazon devices making me think the feud was over) but they would never come up. I then was thinking this Echo Show is very old and out of date so I did a factory reset trying to see if it would update or something to fix the problem but it didn’t. After 2 hours I was ready to return it. The wife and I needed to to get some groceries so we left for a bit. When we came back I asked the Echo Show to show me recipes again and it worked! I asked it to show me a video and it brought up Bing instead of YouTube. I knew it had done a software/firmware update and now it was good. Later I found it has an option to check for software updates in the device options.

Also there is a lot of people saying these are louder and sound better than the Echo. That may be true for the new shorter Echo but certainly is not true about the taller original Echo. In fact I believe my original Echos are louder. Either way the Show is very loud and sounds pretty good.

As far as calling people on phones using the Echo Show it is better than my original Echo in the fact that it seems to have either noise canceling or the speaker mic configuration setup is better and the caller doesn’t hear an echo of their voice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then go through troubleshooting - ""is it ok if I send a test signal to it?""  Ummm... it's dead, unplugged, packed in a box for return.  But ok.

I knew there wpuld be additional fees for things like netflix, Hulu, etc. but figured the capablity would be there to use it.
So I have to purchase a Fire TV stick for 39 dollars in order to watch Netflix or YouTube or see any videos. This is irritating because I only have one TV that isn't a smart TV (which meaning I can already watch Amazon Prime Videos, Netflix and YouTube everywhere in my house) and I really have now need for fire tv. I did read reviews and specs on the fire tv stick and at least there is not a monthly fee to use it...just for subscriptions like Netflix etc.
I am worried that  the fire stick remote and my show will both pick up at the same time because my echo show can pick up my voice from almost anywhere in the house. I purchased an echo dot for my son's room upstairs which is the most difficult place to hear from. Which means 2 will be on the same floor. Praying it doesn't create a hassle.
All in all without the fire stick the, you can still use drop-in feature and see lyrics to songs as well as use apps (some for which have video and/or graphics) but to search YouTube or watch Netflix etc you must have fire stick. Not happy about the extra expense at all. Feel like this feature could have been preloaded in the device.  Which is why I have a 3/5 stars.

I have played around with the calling capabilities a bit, but it is not a primary driver feature for me.
I ordered a couple of items on Amazon PrimeDay from the Echo Show and the process was super simple.  It gave me more confidence seeing the product I'm ordering rather than voice ordering from my Echo / Echo Dot (as I've done in the past).
Now that Echo has a display, I would love to see some apps available for home automation, like visual control for my Hue lights or an app for my Ecobee thermostat.  When Echo/Sonos integration is finally released, I'd definitely like a Show Sonos Music control app.
Finally, I'd like more control over the screensaver, like being able to turn off the ""Try.."" suggestions altogether, instead of just limiting the scope.  I'm an experienced Echo user and don't want to be persuaded to watch ""Dora the Explorer"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like that the music lyrics are displayed.  I connected my Dot and Show to be able to play music simultaneously in the house.  (if you do this, you will need a male to male audio cable to connect an external speaker to the Dot, you won't be able to bluetooth it)  I like the fact I'm able to view the Daily Deal products on the Show.

And besides knowing how to work her Kindle, she cannot figure out any other kind of technology nor does she want to (forget a smartphone or iPad).

Enter the Show!

Set up was easy and I enabled the drop in feature for the Show I bought her and myself. Tech averse relative? Problem solved!  I pop up on her screen and all she needs to do is talk to me — she doesn’t even need to say anything to accept the drop in.

So far, I’ve been able to make sure she was using the right prescription toothpaste (she brought it up to the camera), made sure she ate when she was slacking (talking over the phone wouldn’t have enabled me to see her chilling in bed so I was able to encourage her to get up and go) and solved a problem with her landline phone and answering machine (drop in was the only way I could get through to her).  Total peace of mind and it isn’t much different from me being there and popping my head in to check in.

It is also handy for playing her music and putting reminders for appointments up on the screen. She is a visual person and likes to see her appointments in writing. Further, the Show prevented my Mom from getting frustrated via me trying to describe things over the phone — she just shows me stuff and vice versa now. -)

I actually like using my iPhone’s Alexa App rather than my own Show for drop ins because I can walk around and show her other things. This will also be handy when I travel. Glad I have the Show though.

The less than stellar reviews may want more out of the Show but it has so far accomplished what I want and more. I think Amazon will also enable it to grow.

The 2 reasons for 4 out of 5 stars and not 5? (I’d love to give it 4.5 out of 5!)

1) I wish you could toggle the camera lens up and down — even manually. It is hard finding the perfect thing to place it on relative to the height you need.  A simple dial could save lots of headaches. Also, a zoom ability would be nice.

2) I’d love a bigger screen  — or at least have the option in screen sizes to choose from since others may like the screen size. I’m sure this is right around the corner!

One could use this with kid and dog sitters too. In my case, it has given me great peace of mind for a very special person in my life!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_89?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=89&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have mine set up within 6 feet of my recliner and I usually have to yell the wake word for it to respond. My echo plus is not any better. The irony is that the reconditioned echo dot I have 20 feet away in a separate room will always respond to the wake word while the show and echo plus just sit there, deaf and oblivious. Hopefully they made improvements to the 2nd generation echo show and echo plus but in the mean time I'm stuck with these two expensive paperweights! They both have great sound quality but the frustration of having to repeatedly use the wake word to get them to respond far outweighs this.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My family started off with the Dot and while it was ok, we didn't have much use for it.  Thats until we found out the Echo could be used as an intercom for the house.  We have 2 floors in our house and the yelling upstairs to let the kids know it was time for dinner, to get ready, etc was very annoying to listen too.  Echo solved this problem.  Now, the beauty of the View is that we can video conference/intercom upstairs whenever we need to talk to people on the 2nd floor.  Also, we have a 9yo and 7yo and with no landline and only cellphones in the house (that require fingerprint passwords), if there is a crisis that leaves the adults unresponsive, my two kids would have no way of communicating to the outside world.  Well, the Echo's we now own (5 in total, 2 views) solves this problem.  The kids can now call anyone on my phone list, specifically, both my wife and I, as well as the grandparents in an emergency.

1. The poor quality of this device. After just a couple of months I had to send it back to Amazon for repair.  Alexa became non-responsive, the screen started jumping around, and sometimes If a song was playing it would stop and restart by itself.
2. The poor repair service.  It's been 2 weeks and there is no updated status posted online, so I called.  Apparently, it's ""waiting to be shipped.""  I have no ETA.  I'm sorry I purchased it.

TEN STARS
OMG, I LOVE this thing.  The sound is AMAZING and it carries throughout the house.  So, when I'm cooking and I feel like listening to Jazz I say, ""Alexa, play some Jazz,"" and I hear some of the very best Jazz.  WOW!  The same with any other genre -- great music, great sound.
This is a great device, and the video component just makes Echo better.  It integrates beautifully with everything else.  It's plug and play, just select your WI FI provider.  I didn't have to do any other set up.

It worked awesome as a little always on display showing the weather and for getting the flash briefing before taking off to work. Main complaint though is the screen. About 3-5 months in, I started to notice the screen would be all glitched/garbled up. For example, if you woke up Alexa the blue bar on the bottom would smear all the way up to the top in a glitchy fashion. Sound and Alexa was working fine, just the screen was unusable.

At first, I thought it was a fluke. I'd see that as I was passing by and then 10 minutes later, the display would be back to normal. As time went on though, the fits became more frequent and would last longer. Towards the end, it would go for days at a time. If I unplugged the display, waited about 10-15 minutes and plugged it back in. It would go back to normal. After that it may be good for the rest of the day or it could go back to glitched up after an hour.

Finally called Amazon Customer Support and spend 20 minutes jumping though all of their hoops for them to determine it needed to be returned for repair. They sent an RMA label but with the new system, I couldn't just print the label off and drop it at a local UPS drop box. I had to drive across town to a UPS Store for them to scan the QR code for the shipping label to generate from that. Then on top of this, I dropped it off 2 weeks ago and haven't heard of anything back. Amazon received it almost a week ago and still haven't heard anything.

So in between the screen issue and the clunky return process (which I haven't received one back yet) I'm putting it at 3 stars. Great home assistant but between the poor hardware quality and the pain in the butt warranty process, I'm not impressed.

*Update*

So after returning the Show for warranty repairs, I didn't hear anything back for almost 4 weeks. I called into customer service and all of a sudden a $0.00 order for a Echo Show had randomly popped up in my order history. When I viewed the order though, it still said not shipped. I double checked my tracking number from when I sent mine back and they have had my show in their possession for 3 weeks before even starting to process. I then checked on when I should receive it and was told that Amazon is out of stock on Echo Shows! Downgrading from 3 to 2 starts now since if it does break or have an issue, you may have to wait weeks to months for the repair.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_74?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=74&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here are my issues with the device:
1. There is NO way to filter Alexa apps by ones designed for the show / it's HARD to find video apps.
2. Very lacking in video / display content. I get almost zero benefit from having the screen, only thing I use it for is Bloomberg news, which is from I can tell the only video news app on the device. (It's missing, CBS News, ABC News, Newsy, all the video streaming news that are on Roku devices and my Apple tablets.)  This is my biggest gripe, it's a device based around a screen and it's missing most of the apps designed for a device with a screen.
3. It does not sound that amazing, the cylinder echo sounds WAY better everywhere in the room even if you are sitting directly in front of the show.
4. Takes up more space than it should with it's slightly small sound
5. It's a super dust magnet, I have a lot of other black AV equipment and this thing gets dusty the second you stop wiping it down

Good things vs other Echos (again, I'm a fan of the advantages of having a Alexa device in general so these are the differences)
1. It shows the time
2. I literally can't think of another advantage, if they got some streaming video apps on it then I would be happy with it but I have had it since Christmas and it's the same stuff, I don't think they have come out with any new Echo Show apps since then","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Didn’t realize but Alexa can’t dial 911 unless you add echo connect. Then it gives you the ability to get help easily and quickly. Hooking up echo connect tomorrow. The drop in feature make it a fantastic intercom system to talk from upstairs to downstairs. This along with echo connect would be invaluable for the elderly. My father hated the pendants to hang around the neck. This would have been so great. The drop in feature along with extra security cameras. You can check on parents or infants or any loved one who’d give permission to be looked in this way so easily. The ability to seem like you’re  always home with smart home devices.

They are more than a voice controlled juke box... They adjust my thermostat as I lie in bed and speak my desired temperature; they make my coffee as I take my morning shower; they play soft music and turn off my lights as I drift off at night, and turn the lights back on and wake me up each morning as my alarm clock; they have become the brains in my old landline phone, dialing the number as I speak it; they are my whole house intercom; they are my pet-cam and my nanny-cam; they are my laundry timer; I can ""drop in"" on my kitchen from my cell phone on my drive home from work for a video call.

Showing timers on the screen while cooking is really nice and many of the apps use the screen well to enhance their experiences.  However it feels like the dumbest ""smart"" product ever.  Headlines will scroll across the screen and below it will display ""Say Alexa, what is the story about...""  Reading these verbatim will never get the story about the headline, and a very frustrating game ensues to find the right command to hear what the story I was interested in hearing about actually was.  I know a couple other people who own an Echo Show and they have this issue as well.  If Amazon fixed this issue the Show could easily become a 5 star product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_290?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=290&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sending back to Amazon.","June 17, 2018","I wanted so bad for this to work. I wish I read other review on the Alexa apps for different skills because EVERYONE is having the same issues with the Echo connecting to cameras.

I got this to use as a baby monitor for the Arlo Baby Camera. It’s so inconsistent! It’s connects roughy 1 out of 10 times. On the Arlo app it works great 100% of the time. Even pulling up my Ring door bell it connects about half the time when asking the Echo so show who is at the front door.

Iv spent days in my modem trying different settings for channel, 2.4/5ghz, changing camera names etc. Nothing worked. Not even when each device was in the same room next to eachother.

I can’t believe Amazon put this out just read others reviews here and also on the Alexa app. Also Amazon and Google apparently are on opposite ends of the world and Amazon Echo will not allow you to play YouTube videos anymore. Unreal.

I just printed out a return lable and this is going back to Amazon for a refund.

The spot also has lots of options for how you want the clock to look. This doesn’t. Please let users adjust the size of the clock!
UPDATE: Someone from Amazon called me after I posted the above with one star. She asked me a few questions about what I would like to see. She said she would give my feedback to the developers.

Most of the time, it will not show anything or will only do so for a few seconds before stopping. Still, it works great on the other smart home products and gives good information.

I got it right after they dropped the price below $200 and I'm very glad I did.  I get to watch my news clips in the morning while I make coffee, check my appointments for the day, make reminders for myself and create a shopping list all using my voice.

We have six of these that we have either in the house. or have given as gifts to family members.
The retail of 229.00 is a joke . As an early adopter I paid $160.00 for my first one but they have fallen to $80.00 in AWH Deals.
The Sound is OK, about on pair with the Echo.
The biggest loss was the loss of YouTube.
It was great for videos in the kitchen when you are cooking.
It is now terrible for video.
The most useful aspect of the Show is the drop-in feature where you can remotely check on the house, integrate with cameras, talk to family and use as an intercom throughout the house,
its current price of about a hundred buck is pretty appropriate of its true value.

The dot is awesome, the spot is even better, but this one - the show is horrible.

First, I am trying to understand why you would pay so much for a mini tv. The screen that is the same size as a Kindle has the ability for you to watch apps - the same thing you can do on a Kindle for less money.

Then there is the unreliability. I tried to put it in my daughter's room and have it as an alarm since it's louder than her clock, only this thing is sluggish, delayed, and acts like someone stumbling to get up after a night of drinking. She definitely doesn't understand the concept of time.

Alexa stop! I yell this more times than I care to admit. Why? Because she doesn't listen. Like an onery child you have to repeat the words like a broken record before it sinks in.  We know she hears us as she quiets down and waits for us to say it, but also like that drunken morning, complying seems to be something only the sober Google Home items can do.

If I could return mine I would in a heart beat, but that would require Amazon admiting something is wrong. You see, tech support can only help if she's acting up when you call, but my petulant device acts up when she wants to. A devil in disguise, she wears her halo bright when you complain about the wrong she does, but when tech is no longer listening she does whatever the hell she wants.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

[updated]","July 4, 2017","I got 3 of these when they first came out (there was a promo discount when you bought 2.) My family lives in different parts of the state and we thought it would be nice to interact with them through this AND have the other echo skills (like music, weather, etc.) I have all the echo devices so far except the ""echo look"" (regular echo, tap, and dot.) Each has its own benefits such as size, sound, portability, etc. The screen is awesome though.

I am not sure however if each echo in a different house will need their own amazon account. It is all my immediate family (husband works out of town most weekdays, kids in college, and home.) If they use their own account, they won't have access to the prime stuff since we all share my prime account. But if they all are registered to MY account, how do I call the other one? So far we have only set up one and are unsure what to do with the other two. I may call support to see how this is done and will update my review when I find out. We would also like to use it to check in on our house and cats when we are away, but we don't know how to ""answer"" it if we aren't there. Maybe we can call our phone answering machine and accept the show call with that voice! ha ha!! That seems like a weird workaround. I don't know if there is an automatic setting to answer a call from another show. That seems nice for checking in on an empty house or for someone ill or something. Of course, you would have to pre-approve calls from certain others, but it seems it should be capable of doing that. Since you can connect to other cameras (they show a baby's room in their video) then you should be able to connect to other Echo Shows without a voice acceptance. There is the IFFT app or ""mybuddy"" where someone who wants to alert others with just a voice, but that isn't video yet to my knowledge.

It works just like an echo using your voice, but also has a touchscreen. I didn't really review here all of the alexa features as that has been covered (a lot!) on the regular echo pages, My review is more about the differences. It scrolls news items and tips on the home screen, but you can turn that off if you ask for ""display off"" where it only displays a white on black digital clock. Well, sometimes it works...other times it asks ""which device"" and doesn't understand. I am sure this will be tweaked as the devices rolls out. It is pretty new. The size of the screen is listed as 7"" diagonally, but those those like me, (who can't clearly visualize that hypotenuse measurement!) the screen itself is about 6 inches wide by 3.5 inches tall.

We have indeed checked weather, asked questions, ordered products, and watched youtube videos on it. We aren't good at searching through youtube yet, but it does give you some suggestions based on your command. I am not sure how much we will use the feature for movies or something since it is so small, it would be nice to ask THIS to control your amazon fire stick or something on your tv or to cast your show. But so far, it doesn't do that.

It looks like a black trapezoidal box, and the viewing angle is set. I suppose you could stick a pen or something under it to angle it differently, but again, that is more of a hack than a feature. It doesn't look wall mountable, but more of a counter/shelf thing. I am sure there will be 3rd party wall mounts for this which makes sense for a kitchen or something. The sound is pretty good from such a small footprint. To me, the original big echo has the best sound, but this is a close second. Also, when it is loud (like level 10) this seemed to hear us better to stop than the echo (where you sometimes have to yell to get alexa  on the regular echo to hear you over the music!)

I don't always like to be an early adopter of things since version 2 of things is usually better somehow, and I am stuck with 1. But I really liked the idea of this and figured they could just update the software, not the entire device (like they have with tap now being able to turn on with just voice.) I hope they keep reading our suggestions and will consider the ideas of many of the folks who bought these.

There really needs to be a forum for this product clickable from the echo device product pages! The only ones I found are on the ""kindle forum"" part of amazon (https://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread=Tx20BQ8KTGP9S3Z)  ALL the forums/customer discussions are so hard to find now, that people resort to asking questions on the product pages, and no one wants to scroll through hundreds of questions to find something. If there were a dedicated forum, we could ask questions, find hacks and apps, etc.

update: I chatted with customer service to see how to set up different ones of these on the same account, but in different locations. Apparently, it ""drops in"" in people using the device NAME, not phone number or anything. So I just named them for my family members and successfully connected with them with audio and video. I even dropped in on my cat who was home alone (I probably interrupted her secret alone cat rituals! ha ha!) I sort of like the ability to drop in on my house anytime from another device. There is also an alexa calling feature using phone number of contacts. You can use the Echo Show, Dot, and regular echo with that (only the show will have video, of course.) The main difference I see between the two is ""drop in"" automatically connects and calling announces a caller and you have to answer or ignore. You have a few seconds of blurry time on the camera to turn off the video for drop in if you want. Info for ""drop in"" is here:https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId=202153130

For calling, you can also push the video off icon if you are home dancing naked or something. :D  There are also do not disturb settings so you don't have to worry about someone dropping in on you when you don't want them to! If you are nervous about the camera being there at all, you can always get one of those sticker sliding webcam covers and keep control it like that. Info for calling instead of dropping in is here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId=202136190","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_114?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=114&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's hard to get the right thing to show up on the screen, whether that's music videos, keeping it turned on or off, even prime video content. The video integration seems poor - we'd rather opt for a fire tablet with Alexa. The screen is also a problem at times. I want it to stay off so I can use it like a traditional echo most of the time because it's in our living room and I don't want my young daughter to stare at a screen every time she passes through there, but it'll automatically turn on when someone walks by.

They can no longer work with computers or tablets or even a smartphone. Or, really, even the old phone on the wall. This would get five stars for that ability, once I got it set up. But, even with my 30 years of professional data-communications experience and digital video conferencing management, it took me two long phone calls with their techs (who were excellent) to get it to do what I wanted. Buyers should know that the Echo communications technology is not at all what is to be expected today (in a world of Internet-based video and audio calling, such as Skype and FaceTime). To be precise, the communications do not use a unique Amazon Echo ID (as do, Skype and FaceTime and Google) allowing any two devices or apps on the Internet to communicate. Nope. You must use a telephone number, and that number must be on a cellphone, and actually, on a smartphone that runs this app. Their ads and help files etc., make it sound like the app is a neat and optional feature, allowing you to call from your smartphone. Yes, that works great. But if you just have a brand new iPod Touch, which has all the smarts of an iPhone but no cellular radios (it is NOT a phone), then it downloads and runs the Alex app just fine, but has no communication ability—just plain missing in the app. The same iPod Touch can FaceTime just fine. See the idea? FaceTime and Skype use IP over the Internet and go to specific and unique IDs set up in the servers. I see no decent reason that Amazon doesn’t do this. Instead, this beautiful box (and it is a joy and beauty to own) requires you to have a smartphone pretty much for each device. There is a way to set up more than one of these and use just one account. The techs showed me how. But that meant my parents’ Echo Show was four hours away from me and using my iPhone’s contacts (there is no way to make separate Echo contacts!!!), and it was just a matter of time before they (or their home caregiver) would inadvertently call one of my contacts instead of me. So, we decided to buy them an iPhone. I just set that up last weekend. It is great. The family can now put photos on that new iPhone and their Echo will run a slideshow of those photos all day long. Just say “Show my photos.” I think I would have given this four stars, friends, even with all these issues, except that  Amazon has done a seriously weak job with the user interfaces on the device and on the app. For smartphone users, who we all are to be using one of these, things are just not as intuitive as they should be. Some things are done on the app and some on the Show and a few key things are only done on your web browser logged into your Amazon account. I needed those tech calls to learn that. I am pretty sure all that will get better over time. Will they ever do communications with unique IDs? I wonder. I suspect they like getting their hooks into our smartphones. Oh, well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_128?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=128&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don't know how I ever got along without an Echo Show or Alexa! If you're like me, by the time you put you're ready to put your shopping list together, you can't recall half of what you were running out of. Used to have to stop what I was doing to write it down on my shopping list, but not anymore! No matter where I am (there's an Alexa app for your phone!), all I have to say is ""Alexa add..."". My kids can add things too (be prepared for surprises on your list). If I need to remember to call someone at a certain time, not only does Alexa remind me, she dials the number for me & I don't have to do anything but ask. She shows me my calendar, date, time, weather, even traffic details & keeps me updated with the daily news. OH...& the sound quality from the speakers is amazing!! It's better than my Bose, which was more expensive. I can ask Alexa to play anything from ambient sounds to music & she'll even read my Kindle books to me. She's also a voice-activated camera & a mini-TV!! Want to call up a recipe or a cooking video, she'll do that too. Amazon has a deal right now ... 3 Echo Dots (non-visual Echo) for $75, which is a relative bargain! You'd be hard pressed to find quality speakers like these for $25 each, let alone a personal assistant in 3 rooms! I'm getting an Echo Show for my son & daughter-in-law who just had a baby ... it works as a baby monitor with your phone, or you can pick up Alexa compatible cameras for around $40! You can set timers for tasks when you know you're going to get ""too involved"", or for cooking & I almost forgot...this makes a fantastic alarm clock! You can wake up to any sound you like & forget hitting the snooze button because Alexa does that for you too! Crappy speakers on your laptop or phone? Bluetooth 'em to Echo. Don't want to yell from one end of the house to the other? Intercom. Voice activated calculator...state capitals... translator...random facts...she's a talking Wikipedia. Want to brush up on another language? Change the settings on Alexa to another language. For a $129, this girl pays for herself & then some & I haven't even tried the smart home apps yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Echo Shows are by far the best way into the Alexa interface. Having the visual feedback is just perfect for “dropping in”, looking at recipes, seeing the weather, reviewing shopping and to do list, watching lyrics to your favorite songs, etc.

Pros
• Echo interface is great if you commit to it and the Show is the best Echo.
• Great speaker.
• Visual interface is so much better than just audio especially when “dropping in”.
• Great mic response.

Cons
• No audio jack in or out.
• Pretty ugly overall.
• Bulky even relative to the screen size.
• Set at a permanent angle that might not be ideal depending on where you use it.
• Very expensive relative to other Echo options.

Conclusion: If you have the money to spend this is the best way to bring Alexa into your home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately when I plugged it in and started it up I couldn't connect it to WiFi. Why? The on-screen keyboard would not show up. There was a blank text field for my WiFi password but no way to enter it. I tried everything including restarting multiple times but I was still stuck on the very first screen with no way to proceed.

I thought maybe a firmware update would resolve my issues, so I set up an unsecured WiFi network on my router so the Echo Show could connect to it without requiring password input. After connecting to that network the next screen asks you for your Amazon account and password, which I again could not enter because there was no way to get the on-screen keyboard to appear. But I pressed the disable video button and let it sit for about an hour or so at which point it started downloading and installing a firmware update.

Unfortunately when restarting to install the firmware update it hung about a third of the way thru the process. After waiting many hours for the update to finish with no luck I tried unplugging the device but every time it started back up it would get stuck about a third of the way thru the update process.

At my wit's end at this point, I took my effectively bricked device back in to the pop-up store and quickly and easily exchanged it for a new one. The new one works well.

I mention the issues I had with my first device mainly for the benefit of anyone else who runs into similar issues. I spent hours searching for help with the problems I had but found nothing, so I'm assuming it's not a common issue.

Bought it for my wife to put next to the bed, but immediately stole it and put it at my desk in my office.  This does everything that Echo does, but gives you so many more options with the HD screen.  I have it networked to my Arlo cameras, and like to pull up the baby in his nursery by voice, so that i can keep an eye on him while he sleeps.  I have it controlling all of our smart home lights, thermostats and will be expanding to door sensors shortly.  Our house is 100% Apple HomeKIt driven, but I prefer Alexa over Siri, and have integrated the two seamlessly.  It plays music with lyrics, calls me an Uber when I need one to go to the airport, and handles my calendar for me in a visible fashion.  All day long it scrolls pictures, and pulls up top news stories that i may want to read.  All in all, it is by far the best Echo product, and I am still learning new ways to use it.  The most frustrating part is trying to keep track of all the cool things that this is capable of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A bit expensive
Unpolished in many use cases. For example, UI to Amazon Music needs to improve, no ability to cast songs from a mobile phone to the Show, etc.
Lacks integration with more established apps. For example, currently only supports AllRecipes, which we don't use. Would love Paprika integration

Pros:
Music is a killer app/use case
Fits naturally into our lives
Drop-in is a bit gimmicky but fun feature
Improving every day

An exciting addition to the Echo family.

So I only gave it maybe 1.5 hours of attention, and in the video I attached you can see how easy and quickly you can use this baby!! I have just been able to do the following on command, “Hey Alexa ...:”
1-tell me the weather
2-Hear and see what’s in my calendar
3-read my Audible book
4-read my Kindle book
5-listen to the news stories
6-watch a few min of a movie on my Amazon Prime. (The whole movie was playing, but had to work.)  What’s nice is you can say the name of a movie, and it finds it much faster than using remote on your tv.
7-play photos from my library.
8-play music from my Pandora
9- make phone calls and video calls
10-do a drop in from my phone Alexa App or other Echo to my Show. Great for people who are not quick, children, pets, the elderly or disabled. You can pop in and talk or watch them kind of like FaceTime, but it automatically answers.  (Yes this can be enabled or disabled in case it makes you fearful of big brother and spying. But realize that our phones and computers can easily spy on us as well).
11- Look at nice ambient scenes like fireplace, waterfall beach etc. just say “hey Alexa, open fireplace.” Will give you choices of live ambient themes.
12- order Amazon items or place in cart.
13-raise and lower volume, as well as rewind/forward music, books, movies etc.
14- you can set an alarm/timer for any song you want!! Change it every day to suit your fancy!

Well, except for YouTube right now (since Amazon and Google are in a war), you can do so much and the list is enormous!!
This weekend I will connect her to my Ring Chimes and Floodlight camera. You can use her for so much home automation too.

But I love how you can make calls so easily, and listen to music and books so conveniently. Don’t forget to go to the settings to add your calendar email, music choices, and other apps or devices. You can use the buttons on top of the Show for volume, as well as touch screen to tap things you want if you don’t feel like speaking. You can touch the mute button to the left to disable people hearing you or the Drop in feature from working.  I swear, except for the price (makes sense to buy the 2 deal getting 150 off and split it with someone) than to pay full price. I got mine from Offer  Up or Let.  Go as someone didn’t know the beauty of this baby!! Now I need more and the Spot is next in my gotta get gotta get now wish list.  Watch my video and see some of what she can do. And please let me know if you found my review helpful. Thanks and good luck with your Echo Show!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_181?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=181&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought it new in December of 2017 and in the last month, the speaker started crackling & skipping. This happens when connected to bluetooth, it happens when I just ask Alexa questions & she responds, it happens when Alexa is programmed to do certain things at certain times. I've reset it and the problem persists. I have searched through help and found nothing useful on this site; even the section for repairs & returns provides 3rd party products, and none listed Alexa/Echo as options so I'm at a dead end. I was able to find via Google many customers who stated sending an email in the Alexa app resulted in a replacement device, but I submitted one a week ago and haven't even received a confirmation email, much less a response.

While I've wanted to upgrade to the newer model, and have planned to (with this one going to another room for less frequent use) I'm not sure I will now if I can't even be guaranteed a whole year of use without breaking down.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Beshears","Can be used as a home security style camera.","July 6, 2017","One of the best purchases I've made. I own 2 Dots,Echo,dash wand, firestick with alexa and 2 Echo shows. I gave my family Dots for Christmas because they are so great. After owning nearly every echo device short of the look camera I can say that this is probably my favorite.

I love  the Dots because of the cost, and form factor, I connected mine to a external speaker for the increased volume when playing music. You won't have that problem with the Show. The sounds is worlds better than the Dots and reasonably better quality and volume compared to the normal Echo.

A problem that I had with the Echo was the microphones seemed to not pick up as well as the Dots. I figure this is the dot design is newer and so the microphone setup was likely revised. This very minor problem is also much better on the Echo show.

What amazon did was take the best features of the Dots (the Microphones) the best features of the Echo(the speakers) and made them better and added a screen and camera.

The camera works extremely well, the video calling works great from show to show or to the mobile app.

********* I've found this trick***********************

You can set up all your private echos dots, Echo, and shows to allow drop in. This acts as an intercom system...... WHAT I FOUND is if I'm at work and I want to drop in on either of my echo shows I can see whats going on at my house... just like a security wifi camera. I can drop in on the Dog, etc. Its a great peace of mind to know I can drop in on the shows video camera from my phone anytime, anywhere.

The shows are worth their weight in gold if you ask me.

I'm sure more show specific apps are on the way, and I hope many more visual skills come to the already robust voice assistant.

What I'd like is the ability to ask Echo show for movies and have her send it to the fire stick on network.. (come on amazon, that shouldn't be that hard.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Maybe if it had a Ethernet connection to be faster and an aux to connect to the stereo would be nice.

It could be leaps and bounds better with the current available tech. To pricey for what it is. Doesn't currently flow with life at this time.

On that front, the show is definitely that. However, the developers have missed some opportunities. At the bare minimum this device needs apps (not skills, maybe in addition to skills?) and a web browser even if that seems redundant due to everyone having a browser on their smart phone. Overlap is not necessarily a bad thing (as we've seen with the shows video calling feature) especially when it can be used in unique ways with Alexa.

This is the echo with a screen. I so far like it a lot. I have had the echo since it first came out and have added a few dots to my collection as well. The show is my favorite of the bunch.

Sound- The sound quality is better than the original echo. When turned up it's very loud and I can hear music from it well into the next room and even upstairs. Is it as good as some of the top Bluetooth speakers out there no but its a step up from the echo and I am happy with it. The sound when using it for calls is good very clear.

The Screen- When I first got my echo my first thought was why does this not have a screen? So when I saw the Show I was very excited. I love being able to look at it to see what song is playing or sing along to a song I don't know the words tpp(though its prime music only not your own library which kind of stinks).

Video Calling- This feature was one that I was also excited about. I bought one for myself and one for my parents. We have been using Skype for years but it seems to be getting buggier and more annoying. The show does it well. Good video and sound easy to use perfect for what we use it for. It does stink a little that the camera can not be rotated at all the camera is at a high angle and a little annoying but it's not a huge deal to me.

Everything Else- I am disappointed in what skills work with the show at the moment I am sure more will be coming but it would have been nice to have a few ready to go. One obvious one would be a weather radar how nice would it be to say Alexa show me the weather radar. There is a lot of opportunities here and it would be nice to see some fast acting on that front.

Slightly Annoying- Ugh Amazon stop giving me suggestions to try on EVERY screen. I get maybe having it for a day or two but there needs to be a setting to turn that off pronto!  Thankfully you can turn off the trending news and your calendar and also only have it scroll through them once but I would rather my calendar items be seen all the time not try this or try that. Also more controls over notifications. Yes, you can turn notification off on the device but it would be nice to have skill notifications for each device as well. Also, it would be nice if I do want the news and calendar items to continuously rotate to have some setting for how long it pauses between pages.

Really Annoying- This is more the whole echo line. Come on Amazon it's time to allow all devices to play music at the same time or pick two or more. I don't understand why you have not done this but its time I really hope its on the short to do list!

Overall I think this is a good device and has the potential to be a great device. I know it will get better and better with time just like the echo did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought two, and one works fine, but the second started powering off intermittently and then went black. Good luck trying to exercise the warranty. First they want to trouble-shoot by phone. Then they want you to try a new power adapter which you are required to order yourself after they provide a specific credit. The new adapter did not help, so then they send a label but you need to find your own external shipping carton. I ended up having to return ship the dead device over the holidays. Ho ho ho. By the time I received an email confirming they had tested the device and found it to be defective, we had been without the device for about a full month. Finally received a replacement device and crossing fingers that it lasts. Would never order this particular Alexa device again, given the experience.

If Amazon wants some ideas on how to make the most of it, and what should be next....gimme a call.  I can't wait for this thing to actually be what it can be:
- no reason it can't double as a security device.  Goodbye Canary.....seems like that would be a breeze to adapt.
- need to access Prime video content and 'my lis't from the device (duh!).  the search feature is terrible.
- connect it to my xfinity account and let me watch whatever i want on demand.  i'd never touch my remote again and i'd have one in every room.
- drop in feature is great, but until you announce who it is that's dropping in, and make it so I can choose to accept the drop in or not, it's not a feature that's going to catch on.

Pros:
• It's the best Echo (for the price, however, not sure it's worth it)
• The on-screen feedback is nice
• The speaker sound quality is solid

Cons:
• It's pricey for what it does
• The front-facing camera quality leaves much to be desired
• The fact it has nearly zero touch controls and counter-intuitive
• The Amazon ecosystem sucks and simply isn't user-friendly (Amazon music, photos, etc)
• Can't use it like a security camera

Tips for a future version:
• Add a better camera
• Put a LED bezel around the screen that turns on when you have call so that your face always well-lit
• Make it easier to add photos to Amazon Photo and/or the device itself for family and group sharing
• Allow access to the Echo Show as if it were a home security camera
• The fact that my Amazon Music subscription is locked to one device and not, at the very least, transferable from one echo to the next is stupid","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_61?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=61&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I hesitated buying this, but now that I have it I'm very impressed.The You-Tube thing is easy -- I don't blame Amazon for You-Tube being pulled from Amazon products, that's not Amazon's fault... And I knew going in You-Tube wasn't available. Otherwise, I love the sound, the video screen, the look and features, I put it right on my desk beneath my monitor and can hear it playing music clearly even in my kitchen! It was easy to setup, just connect it to your wifi- network from the on-screen promps, and you're good to go. It has a number of features I may or may not use, but that's my choice and I love that I have the option to pick and choose! Such a great deal for such a cool/functional piece of tech. If I had to knock it for something, maybe it's not the best looking device out-there (not the screen or speaker they look fantastic) I mean the total shape. But otherwise, it's wonderful and I'm really glad I was treated to it as an early Christmas Present!

But then when you want to use it, it has to reboot. I just want the screen to go black. Or maybe give me just the clock.

I'm still struggling with other things that Alexa just doesn't seem to do. I can't seem to get it to ""call"" another unit without the second unit being connected to a cell phone number and Alexa app. (It seems to require an Amazon account too, to be registered.) That seems problematic, because I still want to talk to people who don't care to have a smartphone—like my aging parent. Maybe they'll get some better settings options over time.

I also have placed multiple Echo's in my parents and in-law's homes.  They are helpful and useful.  I can listen to music on one individual unit or thru out the house simultaneously, made my own intercom system thru out with my multiple echo's, get updates as well as drop in on my parents & in-laws. My in-laws are like little kids playing with a toy.  They are amazed at all it can do.  You get really used to having it around once you get one.  The sound quality is very good considering its a not a huge device.  It packs a nice thump to it.  It has more bass than the regular Echo in my opinion.  A wonderful addition to your home.  I haven't used it to order anything yet but it is easy to do so (I played with it but didn't submit the order.)  With the screen you can video chat with another Echo Show, the Alexa app on a smartphone.  You can also see the content asked for (recipes, timer, weather, etc.).  You can also see the lyrics to songs playing.  You can watch movies/shows from your Prime account.  I even have watched NFL Thursday Night Football.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

She might not be for a full techie person, but for those of us who are at the age to just enjoy life, she is great.  I got a couple of echo dots to put in other rooms in the house.

I can't figure out how to make the Show stop telling me that my sister is home or that she did something. I hate having a little person up in the corner of my screen with a 1 on it. I am OCD that way and I can't figure out how to get rid of it. Taping it just shows me who's there but doesn't let me clear it.

Video calling stutters for me and my sister. We are both on very good wifi and it still acts like the video calling in Austin Powers. Hope this gets much better soon.

Hated the screen for movies cause it was way too dim but I learned, from another review, that I can adjust it by sliding down from top of the screen. So added that star back. Still, the instruction book\flyer should have told me that this is how to adjust the brightness.

With the Echo Show on sale, decided to get one.  I used to be tied into Amazon, but now I have Apple products, Roku, and (shhh the G word), but still thought it might be handy.  Turns out I love the show so much more than the dot, and use it a lot more too!

It was easy to set up, and to pair with Bluetooth speakers, but turns out the onboard speakers are as good or better than my various Bluetooth ones. I-set a favorite photo as the background, and mostly ignore the text messages.  I do wish we could program at least some of those ourselves.  I’d also like a built in monthly calender - i use just a few added skills as its too hard to remember the launch phrases.

For me, the benefit of the screen makes all the difference.  It’s better for me to see/read than just to hear.  I have it near my bed, but so i can see it when lying on my side or sitting on the bed (where i spend the bulk of my time).  I love using it as a photo frame, and while the lack of youtube is frustrating, I’ve discovered asking for content brings up acceptable videos from other sites, including cooking, animals, etc.  And, ican ask alexa to play a documentary and she does!  I mostly watch things on the show at night - otherwise prefer tv screen.

The primary use for me is music, relaxation sounds (with video now) and photo frame.  I am hoping for more video enabled skills - there are surprisingly few for how long the show and spot have been available.

Almost forgot the important use - one others have mentioned - the drop in feature.  My grandson likes to use it at night to sneak-talk to Gramma.  My kids can check in with me.  And, with the show in one room and dot in another, i can tell alexa to call or message one of them if i need help.  (I know about the my buddy app - for now i prefer the call/text built in feature.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_438?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=438&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just....Maah","June 24, 2018","I do not know anyone else who has an echo show so I can't use it for the video phone capabilities. If I could, I would probably give it more starts. Things that bother me.

1. If you are not looking at the screen, you can't see the light bar so it's hard to know if Alexa is listening to you. With the original model or even the dots, you could clearly see the light ring from anywhere in your room.

2. I use my show to set an alarm to wake me up in the morning. For some reason, the developers have decided not to put that information on the screen. You have to ask it if there is an alarm set. I would think there would be some information that pops up in the corner of the screen showing there is an alarm set and for what time. Nope, not unless you ask it to show you the alarm and then the information goes away after a minute.

3. I used my old Alexa to control my TV through the Harmony hub. Some command that worked with my old Alexa don't work with the show. For example, I use to be able to say, ""Alexa, pause tv"" and then ""Alexa, play tv"". The pause does work but when I say ""Play"", it wants to look up some random show on Amazon and start playing it. I did get the bright idea to say ""Alexa, resume tv"" and that did work.

4. You can't see messages as clear as you could with the standard device. The standard one has a light ring on top that you could clearly see from anywhere in your room. It was obvious there was a message waiting. The show, put's an icon on the screen to let you know there is a message. If you don't look at the screen, you won't see it.

5. There is a massive lack of ability to personalize the device. You have to have amazon accounts in order to do things. Like you can't change the background without uploading pictures to Amazon photo. I am not sure but this might be a prime benefit. I am wondering if I shut down my prime account, will it still work? I would have thought that you would be able to do more using the Alexa app to personalize the device. As of now, there isn't a whole lot you can do. Not a lot of settings you can change. Like I think it would be great if you could tell it to show alarm clocks on the screen at all times in the corner of the device.

My opinion...If you want a show really bad, wait to buy it when it's on sale. As of the time of this review, it's 159.00 when I got it, it was 149.00. If you can use it for the video capabilities, then I think it would be worth the money much more. Between my old Alexa and this new Show.. My feelings about it are really just....""Maah"".

My Hue bulbs could not be found for a few days but after contacting Hue support I got them going.

After setup though Alexa became a star in my house.  My friends came over for game night and were asking it to play music and view movie trailers and they needed no tutorials or anything.  I recommend putting this in a noticeable and high traffic place like a living room.  That way guests see it and can access it right away.

The smart home stuff can be difficult to sync but once the setup was done I slowly started using Alexa to control my smart home vs Siri because the voice controls were so easy.  There's no buttons needed just a ""Hey Alexa turn on living room lights"" and its done.  The microphone has a very good range too.  I can be upstairs and tell Alexa a command and 90% of the time it works without needing a command repetition.

The easy of smart home control with Alexa was shown to me when I had a family member house sit for me.  I added them to Homekit control but they told me when I came back that the Alexa controls were all they used.  That means no sharing users to allow a buddy to control your home.  Just tell them to ask Alexa and it just works.

My last praise is using Ring cameras with the Echo Show is nice.  The video plays well and I can't wait for future updates because now that Ring is part of Amazon there's got to be some new connectivity coming in the future.  I'd love to be able to get Ring notifications on my Show for example but I can wait for now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The problem is this: it can't play YouTube or conventional video formats. So the impressive large screen with great resolution is just going to be used to transcribe weather forecasts and news headlines 99% of the time.

Here is the problem.  I purchased my second Echo Show so that I could check in on my wife who spends much of her time in bed because of migraine headaches.  After some testing I found that when an Echo Show is connected to another Echo device even an Echo Connect it will output from the microphone a low level sound.  For example use drop-in on two Echo Shows and you will have to turn the volume up to hear the other person.  If you drop-in from an Echo to an Echo Show, the person speaking from the Echo Show will have a low Volume on the Echo.  The person speaking from the Echo can be hear fine on the Echo Show.  I have an Echo Connect on my phone.  If I answer with the Echo Show the person on the other end has a hard time hearing me.  If I answer on an Echo or Echo Dot the person on the phone can hear me fine.  One can make an Announcement from an Echo Show and the volume on all Echo devices will be fine, it is only when the Show is connected to another Echo device that the sound will be low.  The Echo Show if a fine device and I would give it over 5 stars if it were not for this problem.  I have spoken with support and sent feedback, but have not received an answer.  I hope someone will look into this matter and greatly improve the Echo Show.  By the way the Echo and Echo Dots have multiple microphones.  The Echo Show only has two speakers which double as a microphone.  Don’t misunderstand me, I like the Echo Show, it just has an issue.  I like that I can see my cameras and other things that you need a screen for.

Aug. 1, 2018
On my original review I gave the show 3 stars because of an issue stated above.  I called home this morning and my wife asked me if I could hear her OK.  I said, “yes, why?”  She said, “I answered using the Show.”  I told her I could hear her fine (I also have my phone connected to an Amazon Connect).  I had stopped using the show to answer calls because the other person could not hear me well.  Now the show is working well with the Amazon Connect!  When I got home I went into the den and dropped into the bedroom where she was.  The volume was great.  In the past the volume of the person speaking was low when two Amazon Shows were used for Drop-in.  Amazon has now corrected that problem and the Amazon Show plays well with all devices!  I can now set in my living room and control about everything in my house.  As my wife has medical problems I have Shows, Dots, and Echoes scattered around different rooms of the house in case she has a problem.  I am a big fan of the Amazon devices.  I am getting so lazy I may have to search for some diet pills or books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the Echo Show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments.  Since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, I didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. So, last year, I bought and installed the Ring Doorbell Pro in their house, which works very well.  The Ring Doorbell Pro is hardwired and not battery operated. After the skill was enabled, I could tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. You really need a good Wi-Fi router with the Echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. If you have a good Wi-Fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. I thought the doorbell would launch the app on the Echo Show automatically, but it does not. You have to initiate the connection yourself. Hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. I can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the Ring Doorbell Pro.

The battery powered Ring products do not work as great though. When trying to connect the Echo Show to a battery powered Ring device, I get a message saying something like, "" The camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec"". This happens with my Ring Stickup Camera. So, if you want the best experience, you should buy the Ring Doorbell Pro instead of the battery powered versions.

One of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call.  So, we have another Echo Show, just for her, in drop in mode.  This has really worked very well for us since she does not have to fumble and look for her cell phone if we need to call and check up on her. Also, we use to call her cell phone, but then we would find that the phone was not changed enough, so the call would end prematurely, or the call would not go through.  All of those issues have gone away with the Echo Show.  If she needs to call a family member, that's just a voice call away as well.

Right now, she can use her voice to call up movie and TV shows on Amazon Prime.  Hopefully, Netflix, and other services, will also be forth coming.  But for now, the shows on Amazon Video will suffice.  I've outfitted my parents house with Homekit products from Philips Hue, Lutron, and iDevices, and all of them work flawlessly with the Echo Show.

One feature that I found by accident, that I have not found documented anywhere, is that if you hold down the mute button for about 3 or 4 seconds, than a user interface comes up that allows you to shut down the device entirely.  A user interface that's says ""Power Off"" come up.  Then you can either hot OK to power the device off or hit Cancel to go back to the main screen.  We use the timer function a lot for preparing medicine and cooking food.  When I set a timer, the Echo Show actually shows the timer on the screen.  Therefore, I don’t have to ask it how much time is left every so often.  I can actually see how much time is left.  This may sound like a small thing, but it's really very helpful.  You can even dismiss a timer with a swipe instead of saying cancel timer, or stop timer, when the timer goes off.

The Echo Show definitely isn't perfect.  Even though the camera works well, I wish it could swivel so that you can fine tune the position of it.  But all in all, for the scenarios my parents use it for, it works great for a first release.  The ability to check in on someone that's bed ridden, and can't move all that well, even to pick up a cell phone, makes this a great device to own.

UPDATED- (10/02/17)

Unfortunately YouTube is not supported anymore because of a disagreement between Google and Amazon.  Hopefully, this feature will be added back after an agreement is reached.

However, Amazon added a new feature to the Echo Show, and all Echo devices, that allows the user to call cell phone and landline numbers in the U.S, Mexico, and Canada for free.  You don't need to buy anything else to make this happen.  Previously, you needed to use one of the Echo devices, or the Alexa app, to make calls.  Now, you can use an Echo device to call someone's cellphone, or a landline.  This is great for those cases where video calling is not the best option.  When you initiate a call on your Echo device, the person you are calling will see your phone number show up on their caller ID.  They won't know you are calling from an Echo device.

You can either call using a direct number or using a name from your address book.  Therefore, you can say, ""Alexa, call mom at home"", ""Alexa, call dad's cellphone"", etc.  Or you can say, "" Alexa call/dial 1-123-456-7890"".  If there are multiple people with similar sounding names, Alexa will ask you to confirm which person you actually mean to call.  If you press the mute button on your Echo, then it has the same effect as pressing mute on your phone.  Meaning, you can hear the other person, but they cannot hear you.  While on the phone call, you can also tell Alexa to raise/lower the volume as well.  When you are finished with he call, you can just say, ""Alexa, hang up"" and the call will be terminated.  A phone call can only be made from a physical Alexa device.  I have found it does not work from the Alexa app itself.  But still, this is a great new feature that makes the Echo Show, and all other Alexa devices, worthwhile.  Knowing a person, confined to bed, can call you, at any number in their address book, really gives some peace of mind.

UPDATED- (10/11/17)

Alexa is the gift that keeps on giving.  Today, when going through the account settings to enable notifications for shopping, I noticed another option called ""Your Voice"".  When enabling this new feature, Amazon has enabled you to train Alexa to recognize specific voices.  Alexa really has voice recognition now.  After training Alexa to recognize your voice, she can distinguish who is speaking by just their voice.  To enable the feature, go into settings and click the ""Your Voice"" setting.  From there, choose the Alexa device that you want to train.  Then the user interface will lead you into speaking 10 sentences for the training process.  After the training session, it takes about 20 minutes for Alexa to process the voice print.  After that time, you can ask Alexa, ""Alexa, who am I"", and she will come back and say your name.

When doing the voice training, it's a good idea to unplug, or mute, any other Alexa devices in ear shot as they may respond to what you are saying.  Also, turn the volume of the TV, or any other device, to mute so that other voices will not interfere with the voice training.  In my household, this new feature appears to work very well.  When we ask Alexa to play music, she will play music from the specific person's Alexa account.  We don't need to specifically switch account anymore.  For voice calling, Alexa now looks up the person she was asked to call in the person who is speaking contact database, and makes the call to the correct person.  This was a great unexpected feature to find today.

UPDATED- (11/21/17)

YouTube is back on the Echo Show! Also, Vimeo and Dailymotion are now supported as well. If you ask the Echo Show to show you specific videos, it brings up a list of videos that match your request from YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion.  You can then tap the video to bring up a mobile webpage that plays the video.  Telling the Echo to play video #1, #2, etc. also works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Because of that, it seems odd that it would be a problem with our WIFI.  I contacted support, but nothing they suggested worked.

Here's what it can do. Turn off and on lights with the additional special plug adapters, tell you the time, jokes, and weather. It is best at selling you stuff. The music categories play music unrelated or so obscure to the category it is a waste of time. Alexa wants you to PAY for an Amazon music subscription just as it wants you to pay for movies, etc. And it will sometimes charge your account for these items without telling you. It consistently fails to work with most installed skills after a week or so. One of those skills is Amazon's own ring doorbell. This usually fails within one week. I can't get it to work at all now after having fail at least six times. All the other times, I was able to get it operating again. When you ask Alexa a question, you have a 50-50 chance you will get real information related to the question. Other times, Alexa goes off on some other random topic or it tries to sell you stuff you don't want or need. It is nearly impossible to get Alexa back to the present as it refuses to give up what it thinks you want. I installed a skill for my car which Alexa still seems to know is there (both the car and the skill) but while she thinks she is talking to the car as she used to, nothing is happening. Reinstalling the skill does not help. My cell phone app for the same car has never failed. I have worked in the computer and cell phone field, so I understand technology. This is NOT ready for prime time. It fails to deliver.  Amazon marketing has oversold this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Rebooting the unit has no effect. On searching for answers to this problem, I find a lot of owners are reporting this issue. Maybe it's a flaw in the 1st generation Echo, not sure, but it's very troubling for a $200 machine to have issues in that amount of time. Other than this, the basic function of it is great. Its a nice touch to have video and visuals along with the regular audio features of the echo. The drop in is handy - I did not not find it ""on"" by default, for those of you who are worried about surprise room-to-room eavesdropping. You must enable it on the device(s).  To be fair though, the major difference is the screen and that happens to be what is malfunctioning (seemingly pretty commonly) so maybe wise to wait until they perfect these a bit more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_98?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=98&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However my experience is mostly painfully frustrating. Alexa doesn't speak English, she speaks Alexa. And you better remember the syntax, word order, commands, etc... Another major frustration is, even though I have a very quiet house, Alexa is hit or miss (on both the echo and echo show-in different rooms) on understanding what I say. She often answers with seemingly nonsensical answers that have nothing to do with what I asked.

If you enjoy being led through recipes, she is pretty good at that. Some recipes even have video that gives you guidance through each step. If everyone you know has an echo show it might be cool to do the video call thing.

YouTube is NOT supported on the echo show. So don't expect to see music videos... Everything seems to be subscription based, Prime Music, Prime Videos, etc...

Another major frustration is I paused a movie and went to get something to eat and came back to Alexa back on the home screen. The movie timed out and I forgot the name of the movie. I could find no way to get back to it...

I'm going to return my Echo Show and get a tablet for around the same price which will do a LOT MORE A LOT BETTER.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I consider this a non-issue. Amazon gives you total control over which contacts are able to use this feature with your Echo Show. In practice, it really feels like physically dropping by the house for a minute. It's funny how much of a difference it makes that the recipient does not have to physically find their phone or table and press a button to begin interacting with you. Already I'm using it to quickly chat with my son and wife before I get home from work, and with my out of state parents at any time. If you're worried about people ""peeking"" into your home without your knowledge or consent, don't enable the feature. You might as well be concerned about people peeking or eavesdropping through your phone.

The speaker sounds pretty darn good to me. It fills the room and has a decent low end for its size. It looks like if you are not a Prime member, you don't get access to the music library, so you will need to connect to your Spotify or Pandora account. it's a minor annoyance, especially since Alexa is not smart enough to simply use the account tnat you specify. You actually have to specify ""Alexa, play top hits on Pandora"".

The Echo/Alexa platform is developing quickly, but it's clearly a work in progress. It is a new class of device and platform and there are definitely going to be growing pains as the people spend time with it and the market responds.I would like to see better management of contacts, ideally directly through my Amazon account and easily managed via the Echo Show, the Alexa app, or in a web browser. Right now, you need to install the Alexa app on your smartphone, and it will find contacts on your smart phone. That's it. You can't create contacts, rename them, merge them, etc. I get it - Amazon is just starting to enter the world of person-to-person communication and hasn't been at it as long as Apple, Google, Facebook, etc.

I'm not doing much with the Echo as a digital/smart home assistant, but it's very exciting to see the beginning steps of a totally connected ecosystem. Already, I'm wishing that more things were directly controllable with Alexa. Like my Roku TV or Netflix. How great would it be if you could say ""Alexa, turn on my TV and play the latest episode of Black Mirror on Netflix?""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_72?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=72&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.

I’ve been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions:

### What I Like ######

Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.

Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.

Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Show’s touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.

Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.

Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.

Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.

Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.

Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.

On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo.

### What I Don't Like ######

The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen. I trust that new skills will be added over time but I'm disappointed that more wasn't available at launch.

The Show should have an audio-out port.

I wish the Show could have a bigger screen option, a video-out port, and/or video casting capability.

The show should not be used as an alarm clock at this point. There's no backup battery solution at the moment. The display currently is too bright for a dark room.

The angle of display and the camera cannot be adjusted.

None of the Echos can answer all of the questions the Google Home can answer.

None of the Echos can cast video to a TV like the Google Home can.

The Echo Show is not cheap.

### How will I use the Echo Show ######

- Playing Music from Amazon Music
- Watching videos from YouTube
- Controlling home automation products and displaying camera feeds

# # # Bottom Line # # # # # #

The Echo Show is the best Echo available. It's also the best voice activated device available. The addition of the screen makes it infinitely better than any of the other options.

While display and touch specific functionality is limited at the moment, we can trust that both Amazon and 3rd party developers will add new functionality over time.

If you find the Show's price to be too high, the Echo Dot is still a great device. It's also not an expensive investment, should you decide to replace it with an Echo Show later.

# # # Echo Show vs Echo # # # # # #

If you are trying to decide between the Echo and the Echo Show, get the Show. You'll get better audio plus the potential for much greater functionality via the touch screen,

# # # Echo Show vs Google Home # # # # # #

If you want to cast video and audio, Google Home is the better choice since none of the Echos can do this.  Other than that, I recommend the Echo Show over the Google Home because it has more skills and it has a screen.

Yes, the Google Home can answer more complex questions. I just think people will use these devices more for consuming content and controlling smart home products than they will use them to ask complex questions.

I own both devices so I have the best of both worlds.

# # # Suggested Improvements # # # # # #

Add a physical home button and back button on the device and on a compatible remote

Add a camera that can pan and zoom and track faces that are talking.

Add an audio-out port.

Add a separate alarm clock module that is resistant to downtime related to software patching, software crashes, network outages, etc.

Provide a option for displaying video on a bigger screen via a video-out port, video casting, or bigger Echo Shows.

Add the ability to customize the home page with custom apps, custom news feeds, social media feeds, etc.

Add the ability to do image searches and 3D images searches

Ability to display my commute route using google maps, with traffic

Add Skype support and allow voice initiated calls.

Add the ability to stream live TV from a cable box, TIVO, or the internet.

Add official apps for SiriusXM, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. The YouTube app show allow you to log in and verbally access your playlists, history, subscribed channels, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen is just the right size and very useful foe pulling video data when you need it.  My only concern is that I would love to ""video chat"" with people regularly.  However at 229.00, it is not as affordable to everyone as the Echo.  I am hoping they will go on special for Prime members soon.  Many friends and family members would love to have one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_116?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=116&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They found that they could play music and turn on/off my lights at all hours causing lack of sleep and inconvenience.

The Echo Show needs refinement.  Don't buy until 2018 or 2019!!!","August 16, 2017","0:000:00This video is not intended for all audiences. What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player If you were thinking about getting an Echo Show, DON'T.  It's not ready for prime time yet.  I'm no stranger to technology or Amazon devices so I was very eager to buy the Echo Show.  I have a Fire TV, multiple Fire TV sticks, multiple dots, multiple Echos, and home automation running for lighting, yada yada yada.

THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU SHOULD GET AN ECHO SHOW IS FOR VIDEO CALLING.
(and video calling still needs refinement)

I wanted to set up one Echo Show for my distant relative in a care home so we can video chat.  There are two approaches to do this.

IF YOUR RELATIVE HAS A SMART PHONE BUT NO AMAZON ACCOUNT
Setup an Amazon account for your distant relative and log into the Amazon Echo Show using their credentials.  Before you do any calling from their Amazon Echo Show and this new Amazon account, you'll have to authenticate a cell phone number first.  Well, that's not happening because I don't have access to their cell phone and they sure as heck aren't going to be able to set it up on their own.

IF YOUR RELATIVE DOESN'T HAVE A SMART PHONE OR AMAZON ACCOUNT
Setup both Echo Shows on your account and ship one to a relative.  This will work but the auto-answer feature doesn't work.  I work at a software company and we create iOS apps...  the Amazon Echo app is RIDICULOUSLY limiting when it comes to managing devices. (see screenshot images)

OTHER THINGS I WANTED TO DO BUT COULDN'T

I CAN'T LOG OUT!
I have to reset the entire device and watch the intro video show that DOES NOT HAVE A SKIP FEATURE and that video show is just a commercial - it tells you WAYS to use Echo Show but NOT HOW to use the Echo Show.  STUPID.

I CAN'T AUTO-ANSWER!
I can't setup the auto-answer feature.  The Amazon Echo app is not logical at all.  I should be able to set ""Auto-Answer"" in the settings section for each Amazon Echo Show but the options are super limited.

I CAN'T PLAY AMAZON VIDEOS ON IT!
I can't even play movies from Amazon video.  I tell the Amazon Echo Show to play a video, it says it will play a video and nothing changes on the screen. It's connected to my Amazon account but nothing is showing on the screen.  Is it playing on my Amazon Fire TV at home? If it is, why the hell do I need a $229 Amazon Echo Show to do that job when my $49 Echo Dots and $180 Amazon Echos will do the job.

Some other issues that show the Amazon Echo needs refinement...

+ I received a ""Template Error"" issue.  The device didn't know what to do.  I didn't know what to do.  WTF?
+ HTML shows in the news section.  WTF?  This is User Interface 101, don't show code on the front-end...
<b>html showing on news</b>

Overall, I bought two of these Amazon Echo Shows and I was REALLY disappointed.  Save your money, don't buy them.  If you need to check on a relative, just get an iPad.  For $390 (the cost of two Shows after tax and Amazon's $100 off coupon) I can get a iPad with a 9.7 inch screen delivered to my house so I can set up the wifi, and then shipped to my distant relative.  I don't need to buy TWO devices to try to get them to talk to each other and have that fail miserably because they can't even auto-answer the calls from one to another.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Peterson","Used to love my Echo devices; now questioning the purchases","November 19, 2018","I have four of these devices.  Three are in my home; an Echo Show, a Dot, and a first generation Echo device.  My fourth device is in my office.  As a prolific user of Pandora, I was probably using Pandora more than any other music service.  Now, all of a sudden, Pandora has gone completely nuts.  Says I don't have stations that it just played for days prior to that response, and tonight I thought I'd try it again and it shuffled my Pandora stations.  Nope, not what I asked for.  I've checked some other online forums and apparently since about the 15th or so this has been a problem.  I've seen references to an update that screwed this up.  Someone even suggested a conspiracy to get everyone over to Amazon music, which for me is not too desirable.  I have found very little on there that I like.  That's why I use Pandora.  I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but this update was obviously a total whack job.  At this point, I can't say that I'll be promoting Echo to people who ask me about it, whereas before I was a huge promoter.  The whole idea of these kinds of devices is to customize your entertainment, and control certain things in your home, etc.; use it in whatever way you like and enjoy.  Well, if I can't do that, these are basically useless to me.  I have written into Amazon, but they have not responded, so either they are inundated with complaints, or their much ballyhooed customer service is not as advertised.  I'm extremely disappointed, particularly since it's turning the corner to holiday season and I was going to use this to have Christmas music and such playing throughout the house for gatherings, etc.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hopefully updates fix this.","May 19, 2018","I’m a longtime Alexa/Echo user, and Google Home, too, and have several smarthome/IoT devices, including the Amazon Cloud Cam, Foscam IP Cams, and Philips Hue lights, and various brands if motion sendors, switches and plugs. Having all of these prior to purchasing the Echo Show, I was really hoping for something special. I’m not completely disappointed, but I really hope Amazon makes improvements out of its own ecosystem (Echoeystem?!).

The screen is a nice size for watching a video or two, but not much more unless you have it on a table in front of you. This heavy base makes it nice and sturdy for a side table, but I’d not want this on a bar, island or table. Consider where you are placing this and the angle of viewing, as it’s not a tablet you can easily move around and comfortably watch any movie or lengty video without getting a neck cramp. The reason I purchased this was to make use of the Cloud Cam, and it works well for that. The camera connects quickly to the Show and I’m able to see where it’s pointed with ease. Unfortunately, you can’t pinch and zoom the screen unless you enable this under Accessibility Settings, which gives a large orange border around the screen.

For the sound, I have it paired to a large set of stereo speakers and the quality is decent. Bluetooth/3.5mm adapters work well enough. I wish this had a 3.5mm jack though, especially for its size. The sound from the Show’s speaker is decent for the size, and seems comparable to the Echo Dot (2nd Gen). It’s facing forward, too, so it won’t fill a room in the same way a Dot does.

The microphone on mine is horrible. I have it placed on a table directly next to me. It’s maybe 1’ beneath my mouth when sitting and approximately 2’ away in distance. I often have to scream ECHO to get it to respond when even the slightest background noise is present, including music/tv, kids in another room, casual chat between others, etc. I’m used to my other Echo devices which pick up the first time the Wake Word is spoken, or my Google Home, which is the same distance, but opposite table. I’m only aware of the front having a microphone as I don’t see holes, even pinholes, elsewhere on the device aside from the power port.

Amazon likes pushing information at your screen which isn’t really informative or interesting, and on par with a popular meme or something in the news. It’d be nice to have the ability to customize your default screen settings to show more than photos, time and temperature. Incorporating Skill Developers into Echo Show would be nice so I could say open up Hue and adjust lights, or open up a News/Media Skill and adjust the sources like I can in the Alexa app. This has absolutely none of that, although it’d be a nice update.

As for video, don’t get your hopes up until Bezos and Brin play nice. Amazon won’t play YouTube videos and uses Bing and Vimeo instead. A lot less selection on that front, but it’s not a device for lengthy viewing anyway.

My biggest peave is the screen shuts off at 5 minutes non-stop. If you’re playing  Amazon Music through your Show, don’t expect to read lyrics or see the displayed song/artist information or skip/back/pause, either. Yes, you can wake it with your voice, or by touch, but it’d be nice to have the ability to control my device and if I want the screen on 24/7, I should have that ability to use it with Amazon Photos as a digital picture frame. It works for that as described, but does power down for whatever reason.

There’s many things I’d change if I were a developer, but I’m not and didn’t buy this for that. I bought it for what was described, and it does everything said, but not as good as other Echo devices, or non-Amazon devices such as a Raspberry Pi and an old PC screen, mic and speakers using Alexa development tools.

Amazon, at a minimum, please add pinch/zoom without the unattractive border taking up 1/4 of the screen space. Add the ability to interact with Skills as you would with a tablet/phone. Please play nice with other companies. It’d be nice to have content outside of Amazon Video/FireTV type content and be able to say search for a HOWTO video on making Slime or something which Amazon doesn’t provide. YouTube does. Google is far superior to Bing (or A9) for searching. Kids use this, too, and it could be an educational tool instead of just a media output and data collection input. Please open to Developers or update firm/software.

Granted with the Prime discount at $129 it is comparable in price to the non-show Echo. However, it seems the only thing I'm getting is video communication with the other Echo show in the house. We do have the ability to watch the Ring video doorbells and it is faster at connecting to the doorbell than the ring video doorbell app on Android.. It is faster at finding a tile in the same room than the tile app on Android.  For those reasons I'll say this is okay.

Weaver","It's OK, it works for the most part.","April 23, 2018","Generally this iteration of Alexa is good, but with many caveats. One problem is that the background picture is way too dim. The reason for that is clear, Amazon wants their overlayed text to be the most visible and so the background is almost too dim to be seen. I have my Echo Show on the table right next to me, and facing towards me, still it hears my TV, which is positioned on the other end of the room, better than it hears me. In fact it regularly responds to the tv, but I usually have to repeat myself to get Alexa to respond. I made the mistake of buying some products early on that were advertised as being compatible only to end up with items that did not work well with the Show. In other words, the hype was high and reality disappointing. Hopefully Amazon will improve more on the consumer product and less on its spying technology - which is Amazon's main concern.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love my Dot, and it is fully integrated into my daily home life, so I had big expectations for the Show, and have to say I am somewhat disappointed.  The microphone on the Show, doesn't pick up our voices or understand commands as well as the Dot. Also, it's nearly impossible to give it commands if there is any ambient noise in the room, such as the dishwasher running.  The Dot is much better at filtering out background noises, where as the Show requires near silence.  You must use very specific wording with the Show to get what you want, which can be really frustrating.  I'd like there to be more extensive parental controls, since there is video involved.  My children love interacting with Alexa, but because the Show needs specific wording for commands, they have landed on some NSFW content that wasn't an issue on the Dot (and yes, this is when the parental controls were already engaged in settings).  The Show connects only to Amazon content, so you can't do a web search or access apps such as Pinterest, which is huge disappointment, since I store many of my favorite recipes on Pinterest.  I expected the Show to work more like a Fire or IPad, and I suppose that's where most of my disappointment stems from.  However, the video calling is great, since some family members also received Shows for Christmas, the connected home features are awesome, and the speaker really puts out some good sound.  Seeing the lyrics when playing music is a fun feature, that my kids like to do karaoke with.  Overall, I feel like the Show has room for improvement, but that's the same way I felt when I first hooked up my Dot, so hopefully, Amazon will take note of the Show shortcomings and improve it to become more fully integrated.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

 It can not handle to many words in the question.

If Amazon wants us to get rid of our other devices, then it has to incorporate their features into Echo.
It has to stay plugged in to work (I could be missing something).

You also can not remove the ticker information from the home screen because I want to see crap I don't want to see.  Amazon has a potential great product but it doesn't have the basic functions it should.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_241?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=241&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wasn't sure I would like it, but as it turns out, it is my favorite so far.  It does all the things the other devices do, but with added video.  I love that you can customize the ""desktop"" with your own picture.  I also love the fact that I can integrate it with my security system and view my cameras.  I would recommend this device to others that like or have Echo devices in their homes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_216?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=216&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Cons: simply put: it needs more skills to take advantage of the touchscreen, video capabilities, and camera. Right now, the skills are pretty limited and the ones out there are not taking advantage of this platform to it's fullest extent. Case in point, I can view my Ring Doorbell's camera but I can't answer the door through the Show. Another example, I can view my Dlink camera but I can't touch the screen on the Show to pan and tilt the camera. I'm not sure if the limitations are in the Show's software or the lack of initiative on the part of the hardware makers but for the Show to live up to it's potential (and to justify it's cost) we need more offerings specific to this platform.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have had echo devices since they came out. Amazon's drop-in feature allowed our 5 & 7 year old grandsons to call us any time they want. When the Show came out we bought 3 of them, one for us and one for each grandson's house. And do they make a difference! The grandkids just have to says ""Alexa drop in on Nana"" and they can let Nana know that mommy is being mean to them! (hehehehehe!!) And my wife loves it that she gets to see her grandsons every day.

I think you had to be invited and put on a waiting list to buy the first device. I plugged that little tower with the swirly light into the outlet and asked it to play a song, and, wouldn't you know, it picked my favorite! I was hooked!

Fast forward a couple of years, and Echo magically transformed itself into a device with a screen! So, what did I do? Buy one for every room, of course!

The black color is awesome, but I decided to also try the white color, and it's just as beautiful. Plus, I think the light color goes well in places like kitchens, bedrooms, offices, etc.

Anyhow, you don't need me to tell you how nice all of the Echo devices are, but I had to tell ya anynow!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_71?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=71&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lange","Horizontal Streaking problem ""Get Me By FIX"" Found. Exchange showed the same problem as the original.","October 15, 2018","Had the same problem on my original Echo Show and the refurbished replacement that they sent me. The streaking effect in the picture shows up when and if it wants to. It didn't show up on my first one for a few months so I was out of the return or exchange time. Send it in for repair and got a refurbished Exchange unit. Unfortunately it started doing the same thing intermittently after a month or so. I really love the product and the concept but you have to get one that works without this type of issues that can't seem to be solved and are in all the Echo Show products. I have many other Echo products that work great but this one definitely has been a disappointment and a costly one at that.

Update......I have discovered that going into Settings, shutting off the automatic brightness, and reducing the brightness level until the horizontal streaking lines disappear seems to have stopped the the problem. Maybe this will help yours as well.  I don't see the point to sending this one in for exchange since the likelihood of getting another one with the same problem seems very high. It works well since I did this but only time will tell.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Alexa does not hear me correctly about half of the time. Between the other half she gets about a quarter wrong such as, asking a simple question and she doesn’t know the answer or pulls up something completely irrelevant, literally just quitting out of listening to me after I ask a question, or quitting out of a timer when I ask how much time is left.

Edited to add: After leaving my review Amazon techs reached out to me via email. They gave me directions and insight on how to work with my Alexa to have it function better. Following their instructions, I did what was asked to help including having Alexa learn my voice. Now a week after taking those steps, my Alexa is just as unproductive as before if not worse. Things that are happening now include asking Alexa to play a show called Suits and literally everytime Alexa plays a playlist they 'think' I would like which is some weird song or artist I've never heard of or played music even relatively close to what I've listened to. Another thing, dismissing timers I have set with no warning or alert. Like today when I set a timer for my kids food that was cooking and wondered why 7 minutes seemed like it was taking forever and when I ask Alexa to show me my timer, she says there is none. So, now I can't even trust this Alexa as a $130 glorified timer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-1st-Generation-Black/product-reviews/B01J24C0TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_94?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=94&reviewerType=all_reviews"
