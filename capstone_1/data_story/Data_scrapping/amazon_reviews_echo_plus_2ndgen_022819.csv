I was mainly looking for a smart speaker that integrated with Spotify to put in the kitchen and that didn't break the bank. The audio sounds a little muffled and adjusting the eq helps a little bit. I always feel like i'm struggling to get the volume of Alexa's voice and the music just right. In the morning she is too loud and at night when we are working in the kitchen she is too quiet.

CONs: Does NOT support Z-Wave Smart devices!!! Only Zigbee. I have over 50 SmartThings devices (all Z-Wave) throughout my home and it doesn’t see any of them. All other Echo’s allow control of those devices. Very disappointed the new echo plus does not.

This fact is very downplayed on the amazon product page. I went back and saw that it ‘recommends’ using the earlier models for smart hub control but it doesn’t spell out that it doesn’t support Z-wave. I had to search elsewhere to find this answer.

Pretty sure I’ll return them...","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My only disappointment was that the setup was so easy and wasn't much of a challenge.  I have the Plus located in my family room and it's sound quality is equal to my surround sound speakers. I located the Dot in a remote bedroom where it doesn't have to compete with the great sound of the Plus.  With the Echo system I don't need my intercom system any more.  I can play the same music on just one or both at the same time.  You just can't play different music on each speaker unless you have the Music Unlimited family plan which is a significant monthly fee for that feature.  I am having a difficult time holding myself back from buying all the products that can be controlled by Alexa (thermostat, door bell, garage doors, lights, receptacles, fireplace …).  My only complaint so far is that Alexa is not as smart as Google or Cortana.  Amazon needs to provide Alexa with a more robust search engine.  Also, under normal conditions Alexa has very good hearing, she can even hear a whisper.  But, when I crank up the music, I have to shout to get her to hear me.  Not sure whether there is a good solution to that problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

i like it but i think it could be a little more flexible..

I'm Australian, i sometimes sound slightly British from living there also.. i HAVE to have it set to USA English in order for all the functions (recognise my voice etc) to work, but then american Alexa doesn't always seem to know what i am saying.. i think it is short sighted that one would have to put on an american accent for some words to make it work at its best?!

The British and Australian Alexa voices are SO much better sounding too!! , but then the voice recognition would not work because my amazon account is based in the US where i live.. is there something i am not doing right?

I also asked Alexa how to spell a french word and it just didn't have the capacity to do this.. i tried rephrasing the question a few times - it ended up spelling 'FRENCH' bahahahahaha..

In todays world my feeling is AI should be less local and more international.. you've got a long way to go Alexa.. but i'm sure you'll get there! :-)

The other thing i noticed is the volume level across different music, news briefings and Alexa itself are all over the place!! Is there a way to set the sound levels like in MUSIC app on an iPhone that keeps everything at a consistent level?? That is a MUCH needed feature, Amazon... The sound on th eecho plus is GREAT though","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is not 5 due to the multiple over-one-hour calls this took. Now the product itself gets 5-stars!!! We’ve been using the 2-Echo-and-1-subwoofer setup and it is the best! I HIGHLY recommend it!

I have always been a fan of the Echo devices, and when I heard this Echo plus I knew I needed to upgrade my devices. Thankfully the trade-in program is available. Unfortunately, my experience was horrible. I sent in the three eligible devices I had to get their respective upgraded version using the advertised 25% discount. After the devices were received and inspected by the trade-in team, my discount was available. I placed all 3 items in my order but the discount only applied to one. I called in, thinking this was an error and I was told I needed to play 3 separate orders for each discount to be applied. I placed my first order and it worked, but the discount did not apply afterwards. I called in again, and apparently I was misled. Now I do not have my old devices and I only was able to get ONE upgraded device. If I knew this would happen, I would have sent each device individually for an upgrade. Definitely missed the mark with this trade-in program. Not cool, Amazon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the tap, the dot, the standard Echo and an Echo smart speaker, and now the plus.

This one is definitely a step up. The best sound and response of all the previous models.

In a nut shell
The dot is ok. Limited quality sound but small and unobtrusive. Nice for  a bedside alarm, weather information and morning news while shaving.

The tap is the portable and battery powered option that I use in the morning. I listen to a streaming cable news show. I listen to it while in the shower, (it is not waterproof but I have a shelf far from water that it sits on), then while I shave, and I put it in the closet while getting ready and dressed. It's like a portable radio but it allows me to stream internet cable and listen to anything I want.

The standard Echo and Echo with smart options is a great device. The addition of the smart features is ok. It allows you to turn on lights and fixtures, but going into a dark room and saying, ""Alexa, turn on lights!"" is not as easy as flipping a switch. It is ok for lights that are not near the bed and your heading to sleep. But, you'll wake people up by shouting the wake up command.

This one is good for two reasons:
1.) The sound is great. Better than the others.
2.) I got a smart switch and can use it to turn on any number of devices. The hook up was easy and flawless.

Also,
Alexa is adding new skills. If you use a sound machine, she has a sound maker for sleeping. Wake up to the weather, the stock market, the news, a fact from history, and a joke of the day.

If you are on the cusp of buying this device, making this your first Echo would be a great choice. If you have an Echo or tap, this is a good upgrade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought an Echo 2nd gen when they came out. Received it, and was extremely disappointed with the sound quality. I returned it within 2 hours of setting it up.

The Echo Plus 2nd gen blows the previous units away. I get crisp, clear sound with plenty of bass. The volume is great, and the mic array is fantastic (I admit, the mics were great in the 2nd gens too). She hears me from all over the first floor where the unit is centrally located, and sometimes from the second floor. No need to shout, the mics are sensitive enough. I can also play music on the max setting, say ""Alexa"" in a regular tone (I can't even hear myself say it), and she'll pick it right up.

Our 1st gen Echo was getting a bit hard of hearing and was retired to the basement. She still plays great sound though.

That’s when we experienced one of our, all too frequent (two - three time daily)
Momentary WiFi signal service drops - from our only one choice, D- rated local internet service provider (which caused ALL our Echo devices to drop offline - and these devices do NOTHING without a WIFI signal. Zip! Moments or hours later when the same WiFi signal was restored, NOTHING we tried could get the Echos to simply reacquire that same unchanged WiFi signal. After a 40minute tech support call to Amazon none of our Echo devices was able to reconnect... and Alexa can’t do ——- without a WiFi signal. Seriously, an Apollo moon launch seemed easier than getting any one of our Echo devices back to tea quite a simple WiFi signal. After 15 minutes w tech support, we had DELETED every Echo device in our house (and deleted all our playlists, preferences and EVERYTHIG else we spent HOURS setting up. Really! I asked after the tech call went past 20 minutes with no results... Reacquiring a dropped out WiFi SHOULD be one simple voice command or button push (if the WiFi signal /credentials hasn’t changed since it was last connected). After working 45 min w tech support we still had no luck on reconnecting ANY Echo device to our lame WiFi (which can drop in and out several times a day) at which point I asked the Amazon agent  - do we have to go through this entire procedure EVERY TIME our lame WiFi signal drops out for even a second, to which she replied YES - at which point I told the agent to initiate a return for all of our Echo devices and related home automation devices. They were completely worthless to me with this one GLARING flaw. (And I had all the latest 2nd and 3rd gen High end Echo devices. No one thought to fix the huge flaw in three generations of the product line)? Well maybe I’m the only one who has WiFi that comes and goes.

I love amazon and regularly place orders over $1000 a month just because it’s SO easy to do and always flawlessly fufilled...except the one MAJOR, MAJOR flaw in the whole, otherwise FANTASTIC Echo series of devices. The entire dropped WiFi signal SHOULD be fixed (provided the WiFi credentials haven’t changed) with a simple ALEXA, Reconnect to WiFi voice command or a one button push...and be back online and in business right away without the need of a 45 minute PLUS tech support call.

Echo and Alexa are my favorite home Automation /personal assistant/ direct audio command to buy anything and everything from my beloved Amazon account, but this one flaw RUINED EVERYTHING. Other than that flaw I was fully investing into the whole Amazon Echo lifestyle, but unfortunately if your WiFi drops in and out your hosed and the entire investment in time and resources was for NOTHING!","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s amazing how much better two properly spaced speakers can sound, even without a sub. Unfortunately, Amazon decided to release this product without full feature parity of it’s competitors.

As other reviews have mentioned, the stereo configuration ONLY works when streaming music from an online service. If you’re internet is out, or you want to take the speakers somewhere where no internet is available, you can only play from a single speaker at a time. That means local connection methods, like bluetooth and the 3.5mm aux in don’t play on a stereo pair (like they do with Google Home).

I am really hoping this is a software kink that is quickly being worked out, and if support is added I’ll update this review. For now, I’m quite disappointed that I purchased a stereo pair of speakers and sub when half the time I only hear sound out of ONE of the three devices.

Do yourself a favor and get a Google Home, Sonos, or if you don’t mind wires and want Alexa, get a Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 with an Echo Dot— much better stereo sound, lower price, and more functionality.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Garrick","Great promise but poor reliability, strange happenings, primitive app, and so-so tech support","January 15, 2019","The promise of Alexa/Echo is awesome.  Connect and automate virtually everything in your house as well as various communications alternatives and other services and functions, and be able to control it all through voice (by talking to it).  The main problem, however, is that it's unreliable.  For this reason I give it 2 stars.  The promise of Alexa is like a dial tone (remember that?) or your Internet service.  It becomes an essential part of your daily life, and you expect it to WORK 99+% of the time.  If it doesn't, it seriously damages the fundamental value proposition and causes frustration, inconvenience, or worse.

There are MANY companies who make ""Alexa compatible"" devices such as Wemo, Phillips Hue, etc. including Amazon itself, and as I'm sure you've noticed, many items sold on Amazon say ""Alexa compatible"".  The problem is that on a pretty much random basis, items will lose their connection to Alexa and won't work through Alexa although the item itself still operates, and/or can be controlled by it's own app (such as a Wemo or Hue device).  From everything I can tell, it has nothing to do with the Wifi connection since I've tested for strong signal strength and hi bandwidth, and there is no discernible pattern.  A device will simply stop operating, and you get an error message in the app that the device is ""unresponsive"", or some other message.  Also, sometimes the Echo will just not recognize what you are asking.  I have an Echo plus, and two Dots.  For some of my switches and lights, one Echo will recognize what I am saying, but another may not.  Yet they are all connected to the same account and this happens relatively randomly for a given device, again there is no pattern.

So, it's just REALLY frustrating that on a fairly random basis, Alexa will just not work for a particular device at a particular time.  I have to re-set, re-discover, re-connect, or re-install that third party device.  BTW, this ALSO happens with Amazon-made devices, such as the smart outlets.

Also, there are different degrees of ""compatible with Alexa"".  Some third party devices work completely fine through Alexa, but others have only partial functionality compared to using their own app.  This is a problem since the promise of Alexa is a single point of control, but if you don't get to fully use the features of the particular device, you may have to occasionally resort back to using the third party app for certain features and functions. Check the ratings of your third party app integration.  For instance, Ring makes very popular devices such as video doorbells yet it gets only 2 of 5 stars when connected to Alexa.

Also, I don't see why video devices such as security cameras can't be viewed through the Alexa app. You can (sometimes) control the device through Alexa, but if you are using the Alexa app, or if you don't have one of the Echo video displays, you can't actually use the cameras through the Alexa app.  This is a big limitation since why should you have to purchase yet another video screen to use with an Echo, and sometimes if you're not at home and have to use the Alexa mobile app, you ought to be able to see security camera video through the Alexa app instead of having to switch to the third party app.  After all, isn't this part of the promise of ""controlling everything"" with Alexa?

These issues are particularly problematic when you are out of town and trying to control things at your home, so when an item doesn't work, you may not be able to correct it (such as if it requires a hard reset).  And if you want to check your security cameras, you can't get the video feed through the Alexa app.  If you have any significant degree of home automation, you cannot (as far as I can tell) do it all through Alexa, you have to use multiple apps.

Also, an Echo will occasionally do strange things for no reason.  Yesterday, my Echo Plus started making two beeps every five minutes.  All day long.  My two Echo Dots did not beep, just the Echo Plus.  There were no alarms or reminders set, and the Wifi in the house was fine (actually my access point is in the same room as the Echo Plus, only a few feet away, so signal strength and bandwidth are strong).  When I woke up this morning, the beeping had stopped.  I have no idea why. Tech support said if it wasn't an alarm or a Wifi disconnect, they had no idea why and offered to remotely reset the devices, which arguably should never be the solution for such a highly-touted system.

The Alexa app is surprisingly primitive and cumbersome despite the elegance of the overall Alexa system and Echo devices.  It takes too many taps to do simple things, the navigation is cumbersome, it doesn't remember your place on a screen, it is often slow to connect with the native app of the device you are trying to control, it's unattractive, and in general it's probably the weakest link in the whole system.

Finally, as far as Amazon tech support, the ""pros"" are that if you dial the number, you get a live person within a minute or so, and the person you get is eager to be helpful and sounds as if they enjoy their work and want to do a good job.  The ""cons"" are that unless you are lucky, you often get a person who barely speaks English fluently and you have to talk slowly and repeat yourself.  Also, they rarely know the answer you are calling for off the top of their heads, and have to put you on hold while they research it.  Fortunately, they are better and faster at researching the knowledge base than we are, so I often find it still better/faster to call than to try and find the answer myself although I will first do a quick Google search to see if the answer quickly pops up.

Anyway, as they say, buyer beware.  Overall, I like using Alexa, but you need to understand it's quirks and limitations.  Some day, voice-controlled life as promised with Alexa (or competitive systems) will be here, but today is not that day.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The previous two are Echo Dots.  Our primary use has been streaming our Amazon Music. The sound quality of the second generation Dot is not adequate for our purpose so we use the 1/8"" jack and plug the Dots into stereos.  That arrangement works great for playing music, but we do not keep the stereos on 24/7.  Thus, we miss out on many of the Echo's available features.  The reviews about the sound quality of the 2nd-Gen were mixed, but Amazon incentive discount was enough to make it worth the risk.  Glad we took the plunge.  At volume 3 the sound fills our living room.  While a single Echo does not deliver stereo, we do not miss that for casual listening.  When we want stereo we do what we always did and play a Dot through a stereo.  Now, we are using many of the additional features of Echo devices.  Simple things like controlling lights, checking weather, and using the timer feature when cooking.

Currently, when using the 1/8"" stereo jack Echo device speakers are disconnected.  Understandable in that competing with the stereo speakers is undesirable.  However, an improvement to all Echo devices would be the ability to leave the device plugged into a stereo and then use voice commands to select between device speakers or stereo speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought two to pair with an Echo Sub Woofer and am blown away with the performance. My Echo Dot's are great but the Plus takes my Alexa eco system to the next level. They are hub capable but my Show handles that duty but it's nice to have the capability in case I move things around in the future. There's definitely more capabilities for me to learn but I'm very happy with this purchase.  I really like the look and feel of the gen2 compared to gen1. The gen2's look high end compared to the gen1 plastic cylinder. The hardest decision for me was what color to pick but I'm pretty happy with charcoal.

I didn’t see the point in having a robot listen to mine and my family’s every word. I read reviews and my boyfriend and I laughed at people saying they have 7 or 22 of these around their home, “what weirdos” “how lonely do you have to be?!”. I thought you just ask questions and she replies. How stupid.... WELL we love this. We purchased this one and a 3rd generation dot (one for the living room and one for the kitchen) I ordered the 2nd generation for as a grab bag gift for Christmas because everyone almost passed out last year when they saw that this dot was in a pool of gifts. We’re keeping all three. Living room, bedroom and kitchen, we even bought the light bulbs that Alexa can turn on. This thing can make grocery lists and it’s automatically on mine and my boyfriends phone (love love love this shopping list feature!!). We can talk to each other from one room to the next, my boyfriend keeps playing the worst music from the bedroom into the living room while I’m cleaning just to get a laugh. This is a nifty thing and we love them. If the government is listening to our every word, we’re going to get our own reality show. AND if these things start speaking on their own, I’m throwing them out the window and will update my review. But for now we really dig them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

As far as speaker goes, this is great, but that is where the greatness ends.  What I really wanted was not only a great speaker (which this is) but MOST IMPORTANTLY I wanted a reputable and consistent personal assistant.  Time and time again Alexa could not find or provide simple data.  I did side by side comparisons between SIRI, ALEXA, and Google and google won all the time. The replies were more detailed and concise. Since I really will not use this device as a home smart hub, it was paramount that I was able to obtain data on demand and all the time. Alexa came in last. Simple questions like ""What is Mrs Claus First name"" or ""What is at the convention center today"" or ""who played ZUZU""  Alexa could not answer.  GOOGLE did every time.

I will say that right now we're kind of using it like a glorified radio. I finally added a smart bulb today, but the prices of the smart plugs and light bulbs are ridiculously high. Although, Amazon did offer a deal on a smart plug. Unfortunately, try as I might I could not order the plug thru Alexa. Her response to my order was very confusing. I still don't understand how to do this properly.
I have to say the startup instructions were poorly presented. After a hour I finally located the right screen in the app so that i could interface Alexa to our Wi-Fi. I suppose Amazon designers would argue that the Echo Plus operation is very intuitive. I would disagree to some extent. Anyway, the on line instructions leave a lot to be desired in the clarity and the use of graphics. I might upgrade the rating after we use this more. It's still something more akin to a toy and a really cool radio.

I love the ability to ask Alexa to “play Spotify everywhere”. What has been missing is a deeper sound with real base. The new echo, combined with the sub, fixed the problem. The sound coming from the new echo is a noticeable improvement. If you add the sub, your house will be bumping. The sub can be combined with any two identical echos. I purchased two echos and the sub, separated the echos into different room and places the sub in the middle. The result was a deep sound and real base throughout my house.

It is a breeze to set up too.  If you have TIVo, as I do, and want it to turn the TV on or off, you have to use a smart plug, otherwise it works with TIVO to change channels without the smart plug.

I do want to warn those who might have an issue with the Echo that they need help with to be aware that there is an online scam from a company called, ITS support, where they will try to sell you a repair contract for $149.99.  I Googled Alexa (instead of calling Amazon for help) and found this site that looked like it was an Amazon site.  They had me try to download the Alexa app, but the download failed each time because the website it rigged to always show a failure.  That is how they get you to purchase their product.  They tell you that you have viruses on your computer and go through quite an elaborate scheme, taking control of your computer, pretending to scan and clean up the so-called viruses.  All of that is fake. They are not really doing anything.  It only appears that way.  I had a gut feeling about this and called Amazon.  At Amazon, I was told that they would never try to sell you something to fix the issue and that they had no record of my call.  I mention this because someone in  one of the reviews stated that he was told to buy a fix for $149.99, and it seemed too coincidental.  I had to change the password to my computer and a few other things because they almost pulled the wool over my eyes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not only was the set up super easy but Alexa is so helpful!  I am not sure how we managed to keep anything straight before getting this!  I have used the Echo Plus for multiple things from creating and adding items to a shopping list to playing music while cleaning and all of this completely hands free.  No more paper shopping list that gets lost and no more searching YouTube for a song that I want to hear.  I simply say ""Alexa, add milk to my shopping list.""  Or, ""Alexa, play today's hits.""  The best feature is the hands free knowledge that is just a question away.  While making sugar cookies I needed a conversion for a measurement and my hands were covered in dough and flour.  I simply asked Alexa for the conversion and had my answer without needing to stop, wash my hands, and use my phone or cookbook to look up the information I needed.  I was also able to set my timer for the cookies by simply asking Alexa to set a timer for 8 minutes.  A timer alarm on the Echo Plus alerted me when to remove the cookies from the oven.  The Echo Plus links to my iPad and several wireless speakers throughout our house.  Linking the Echo Plus with these items was a breeze by using Bluetooth and only took a few seconds for the Echo Plus to find.  I would highly recommend the Echo Plus (2nd Gen) to anyone looking to purchase one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So now that I have played with it and educated myself with the help of the fantastic Amazon tec support people I can give a better review. Ok to start with if you buy smart life bulbs and can’t get them to work there are like a dozen smart life apps my best suggestion is look at the picture of the name brand and then look for that same picture on the smart life app that it matches.  Then you got the right app for that light. And if you still can’t get it to work ask amazon tec support to help you they are amazing 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼The Alexa plus is wonderful you don’t need Amazon music or any of that it’s built into the Alexa you just say Alexa play me some blues or play me some pop music and it will. Find out how cold or hot it is outside or the traffic she will tell you.

I ordered 2 echo plus and the subwoofer bundle. I couldn't be happier for the price the sound is impressive at volume 4-8 any lower and quality is lost anything above 8 getting distorted but 8 is quite loud for the size of the speakers. The built-in hub working well quickly connected to my 2 Ness thermostats and 4 smart outlets plus 3 firestick and dish receiver all with little effort. Only complaint I have is it cant be used as sound for TV you can get 1 speaker to work connecting via jack but not Bluetooth or as 2 echo speakers with subwoofer is really disappointing. BUT it is just a software developer issue so hopefully this feature will be added in a update.  Amazon how about a fix for this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve had her for a while but sometimes i get aggravated when Alexa doesn’t understand what i’m saying (& i don’t have an accent). sometimes when i tell Alexa to play music, it plays a completely different song than what i asked her for. another thing, i wish that you can use skills when creating a Routine. I’d love for me to say “Alexa, good night” and for Alexa to be able to say goodnight, turn off my lights, turn on my Humidifier, and play a relaxing ambient sound. It can do all that’s in one except for playing relaxing sounds in a routine.

Another thing, when i say “Alexa, help me relax,” Alexa tends to over complicate things. she talks waaaaaaay too much when i ask her to help me relax. i really hope Amazon lets us add a skill in the Routine section. The routine section is so limited.

Last thing:
one of my favorite things is the sound quality of Alexa. one word: AMAZING!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don’t think I’d have ever bought this for myself, but it is useful.

Using it with Alexa is much better than using Siri, which we seldome use.  Alexa is so much smarter than Siri and gives in depth informed answers to difficult questions.

Payne","Smaller Size with more Features","December 7, 2018","Surprised with the temperature in the room showing up on the Alexa app - pretty nice to have a temp sensor, that should work nicely if/when I get a smart thermostat.  I'd hope The Echo Plus can be used as one of the extra temp sensors the thermostats need if you want to control the temp by room.  That would be one less purchase I'd need to make.  I like the smaller size and the fabric, nice touches.  Purchased for the Hub functionality and I like that I can consolidate my other devices onto here and get rid of my other hubs.  Controlling things all in one place.  I can tell Alexa to do it verse going to my phone and using an app.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My first venture into the world of Echo and Alexa.

And thus far I’m loving the experience.

I purchased ten smart-bulbs but have only utilized two... a little nervous about how to pair bulbs in one unit. I’ve no interest in bulbs which can display millions of colors (I stopped dropping acid decades ago).

What really amazed me, though, was the sound quality of my two Echo Plus’s when paired as ‘stereo.’ Since Apple Music is now an Alexa skill, I played some complex and demanding tunes and they sounded truly exceptional. A real OMG realization!

When I think of 2.1 sound — with a subwoofer — I generally think of sound for films. But I’m going to try it for music, I think.

And I need to get those bulbs up and working!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It may go a day, it may go 2 weeks, but eventually, it drops off of WiFi and the reconnection process is awful. It errors out over and over with no troubleshooting or error codes. I've tried 2.4GHz and 5GHz, automatic setup and manual setup, setup via phone app and setup via web browser. I had a Dot with no issues before. The router is literally 6 feet away from the unit. This is a major inconvenience for any smart-enabled appliance or device connected, especially some that are accessed through the hub, such as lights. It makes morning routines, alarm management, and other used functionality absolutely useless as it'll be days before I can reconnect. I'll periodically try again and again and eventually it work for no reason. I am living in an apartment complex with lots of other wifi enabled devices but that should't be an issue. Sometimes rebooting the router works but rebooting every week or two is an inconvenience that is unacceptable.

That being said, as for the actual product, I'd give a 5/5 if not for the technical issues. I will complain that  the unit doesn't seem to hear me as well as advertised. Living in an apartment, I can't be screaming across the place for the Echo to hear me. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, especially when it seems like it should (clear line of voice travel, reasonable volume), or it will hear the ""Alexa"" prompt but not the command. The sound quality is pretty good. Definitely not premium but way better than the Dot and good enough fidelity to play music. Clear voice and sounds makes a pleasant experience. They could improve by adding another light as say a night light, or an RGB LED or even making the ring RGB (rather than blue, orange, and red).","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like that it can hear me if I talk decently loud from the other side of the house (and that I can hear its response) but it does occasionally just completely flub a command by somehow hearing it as some form of ""What time is my alarm?"" or ""Set a timer"".

Dropped another star. It can't even google search. Ask it any basic question that can't be found on Wikipedia and you'll get the incredibly useful ""Hm. I'm not sure."" Useless.

It boasts itself a calculator. It sucks at follow-up questions. Too slow. Faster to just take out my phone and open the app.

I needed to find out how to ""fix"" my rice - it wasn't done when it should've been. Alexa responded ""No clue"". I asked again in case it just didn't hear me. ""Sure! Here's how to make rice cakes!"". Frustrated, I shouted over at my phone a bunch of profanities along with my question. Google Assistant KINDLY and ACCURATELY told me how to fix my rice. The first time. Without fail.

Have the dot and normal echo already and have to say the sound is alot better from this. Lows are alot more audible and all sounds are clearer. Only downside I can see is getting more than one in a group of speakers seems to be impossible.

I used amazon warehouse to order the 2 I purchased and it said there was signs of use but other than being in a generic box and shrink wrapped I saw nothing to indicate use... for this I got nearly 50 bucks off both my echoes. I would encourage anyone to buy them this way and save some coins...

Huge plus to echoes is being able to do things like start the car or set my security system through alexa. Because of this I'm joining the smart home revolution lol.

Amazon get the grouping straightened out and let me use all my echos in a group and enjoy music through my whole house!

Now it pairs with the sub but it will cut out almost on every song that is played.

More details on our cons, as the pros have been covered by many other reviews.

- cannot be set up from ethernet connected PC, requires either mobile app or wifi PC
- whisper mode is cool, but rarely works - the volume between ""too soft - can't hear me"" and ""not a whisper - use normal volume"" makes it very hard to get the whisper reply
- bummed that the smart home connectivity for Hue bulbs is limited to so few capabilities compared to a dedicated Hue hub

We have had several Echos over the years, and this is a replacement for an older generation, and I hope this one avoids the problems we have had with those, because they are now essentially paperweights:
- a recent firmware update (sometime in the last 3 months) killed the ability to connect with our router's 5GHz or 2.4GHz wifi, either as an existing, new, or factory reset new device. We had two identical ones, both replaced by these. One went to the garage where it was rarely used, noticed it was not connected about 2 weeks ago, but figured it just needed a reboot; however rebooting it didn't reconnect it. I hadn't used it in a while, figured maybe it died from the cold or something. The second was in storage in the house, so I got it out to use instead, and it powered up and connected to wifi fine - I checked weather, etc. to verify it was ok. I left it alone a few hours, it got an update and restarted, and was then in the same boat as the other one - no wifi connection can be made with any combo of settings I can try, but it does connect to the Android app via the Amazon wifi step of setup, so the hardware seems fine. All our newer Echos - Echo Plus, Echo Sub, Echo Show, Echo Show 2, work fine with the same settings.
- the Android Alexa app pops up an error message when wifi connectivity fails during setup, which covers the first two input fields on the page (network name and password) and can't be dismissed, making it difficult to edit the form without killing the app
- the Android Alexa app flips the phone from standard WiFi to a peer-to-peer Amazon Wi-Fi with the  Echo during setup, and killing setup or failing setup leaves the phone unconnected to the internet unless you go back and reselect your normal WiFi network in Android settings
- support was free, but very slow (3+ minutes to type each response, I think they were in multiple simultaneous chats), and ineffective - they just followed the flowchart, ignoring what I told them I had already done, and asking the same questions over and over; the only new thing they had me try was the factory reset paperclip button, but it made no difference.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No match!","December 10, 2018","Not very impressed with Amazon right now.  I purchased the new Echo Plus as an upgrade to our 1st generation Echo.  I was interested in the Home Hub option and the better sound quality was definitely a plus.  I happened to be on Amazon just a few days after I ordered the new unit and I saw that it had gone on sale for a lower price.  What I came to find out is that Amazon does not offer price match on items purchased.  I spoke to a rep on the chat line and they said, while they don't price match, you can return the Echo and order a new one at the lower price.  This is ridiculous... Amazon basically pays for twice the shipping (returning the old unit and shipping the new one), rather than a simple adjustment to the payment method that was originally tendered.  I would understand if the price went down and I didn't notice until after it was too late to request a partial refund, but 4 days?!?!?!  Come on!!  Jeff Bezos... not a good choice for customer retention.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would have paid 60-70 bucks for the speaker alone.  Pair that with Amazon Alexa, and a built in Zigbee hub?  This device is an amazing value for what you get.  Once they get the subwoofer sorted with working for content that isn't streamed and with the fire tv, I'm buying another one or two and a sub or two.

I should probably add, within a week of owning this my girlfriend bought two echo dots to put around our house.

It will I'm sure take some getting used to so all the features can be explored and used depending on need. However, Amazon Customer Service is another issue. I am not sure that Prime and it's membership cost is worth the price when having to reach and deal with them. Granted, I am learning what Amazon is all about but, the volume of emails received can be burdensome and returns are difficult to process.

I am very picky about sound quality which kept me from buying the first gen Echo. I thought the sound was too tinny. The Echo Plus sound is REALLY GOOD with nice bass and sound balance. Aesthetically pleasing also and the mic is very sensitive, picking up my voice easily even to almost a whisper. It's not a Bose, of course but for a portable speaker this is REALLY good. I may get 2-4 more for the rest of the house.

For those of you worried about smart home privacy, the Echo will not unlock doors or disarm a system. Lock / arm only which I appreciate.

The only thing I wish it had is a rechargeable battery so I could take it anywhere in the house more easily but for now I'll deal with the plug. Hope the 3rd gen comes with a battery.

I compared it to a 1st gen echo plus and this has deeper bass and overall better sound quality.  I do miss the twist to turn volume up or down from the 1st gen. I felt this was much easier to turn down volume manually. With this 2nd gen echo plus you have buttons to press for volume up/down. great little speaker and would buy again but for price I paid which was about $110 130$ is a bit overpriced.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Read to bottom for update","November 29, 2018","My echo plus setup experience was very interesting! The Alexa App is instrumental in the set up, so  were my headaches caused by the app or the device? After logging into the wifi system and thinking i completed all that was necessary, i was left with a message in the device area. It said echo plus not available and needs to be removed. I tried a few things, unplug, plug, hold down reset. While i could ask and get response that indicated connection to internet, the device on the app, had no other means of editing or setting up. I called support and got a very helpful agent. Together we explored aspects of the Echo interface to no avail. Finally something happened i now had a new message on app “device is recalibrating and could take awhile”!
I asked the agent if this was unusual, and was told “very uncommon”, and she would call me back in a couple of hours.
Things i learned, in lower right corner, icon looks like house with vertical bars. This was the access to device setting. Once my recal competed,  when using the menu on left, selecting device i was greated with my room temp! Look in upper right on this screen find 3 dots. Touch those then menu for this device opens. I created a group for origional echo and new echo plus naming it “everywhere”! So now i can say “alexa play _____ music everywhere” and both units play.
Now i need to find out how to change phone number (cell right now) to a different number, to utilize phone call out. I did use it to try it out and that worked fine.
Now i still have question on the aux in? Can i use IPod to play my own music. As a prime member i can play what is on Amazon Music, by asking.
Oh the agent did call back as promised, so i asked her about the aux in use, the response was try it.  I havent.
So what could make this better? Maybe a PDF style manual explaining the app interface and what icons are, and what each will do ( like the house i mentioned earlier) vs guessing.
Sounds great but came close to returning that is why i gave 3 stars.

BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this.

The Echo Plus does have a ""smart hub"" that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE.

What you can do with the Echo Plus alone:
1. Voice Control the lights.
2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the ""16 million colors"" that the HUE bulbs are capable of.
3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice.

What you CANT do without the HUE Bridge:
1. Compatibility with many more sensors
2. The ability to automate and set scenes
3. get system updates over the air and future features.
4. Have your lights sync with music
5. Probably more, but I can't remember.

Also, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights.

What bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs.
Craig
I would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box.

Hope this helps,

Craig M","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

We gave three as Christmas gifts (which everyone is enjoying), and we placed the other five throughout our house.  We use them for music, news, scores, general information, and even as a household intercom system (Alexa, announce: blah blah blah...).  I've ordered electrical smart switches and relays to operate our pool heater/pump and our driveway gates.  Love this!  There are, I know, privacy concerns, and I certainly wouldn't suggest telling Alexa anything you wouldn't want to be repeated in a courtroom someday, but the flipside of that is that you can use the Echo App on your smartphone to see what your family or guests have said to the unit, and also to disable/enable purchases, explicit lyrics, and other unwanted ""features.""  My favorite, since I travel for a living, is to use my phone from another state or country to make announcements to my family back at home.  I recently had Alexa sing Happy Birthday to my daughter while I was away.  I followed it with a personal birthday message using the Announcement feature.

While my expectations weren't HIGH, for the price I was hoping that it would sound better than my 1st Gen Echo Plus.  Yes it's less tinny/bright..and a bit deeper bass, but the bass is muddy.  Not sure its really an improvement audio-wise from the 1st Gen.  I have many little DOTs and have them connected to higher-end speakers.  I was hoping that this Echo PLUS could be in my kitchen near the sink while I was doing dishes and listening to Classical. But I'm going to have to connect this one to my Mini-Bose speakers too.  Maybe it will sound better with Pop music.

The speakers are pretty good for this price range and at lower volumes. While they don’t come with an equalizer, 3 sliders control bass, mid range and treble. Naturally you won’t get bottom range frequencies.

And it’s all voice controlled. Yes I know the arguments against having devices communicating your actions to a remote server and reliance on the same.

I was able to configure the mobile app and started to make the system into my own. I love it. Talking to Alexa is a little strange at first but, you get use to it and even say ""please "" and ""thank you"", when you don't have to. What really got me excited, I learned I could make phone calls from the device. Yikes--I made about 12 calls. I have since purchased an Echo plus which has the built in hub for controlling lights and other devices. I may consider other devices as I discover how to use the system for practical purposes and fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

ok.  Excellent service so far but there's more.  I opened my Alexa app and had an extra unit I didn't remember naming,.

Morgan","The Plus (2nd Gen) is the Echo you are Looking for.","December 22, 2018","The echo plus (2nd gen) is a fantastic device.  The sound quality is great for the price.

I have both the echo plus and now the 2nd gen plus.  The first difference you will notice is sound quality.  The 2nd gen is dramatically better.  I remember getting my first plus and was disappointed with the poor sound quality.  The 2nd gen definitely addresses that.

Overall the echo devices are great I control much of my house, lighting, alarm, and temperature through my echos.

What I like most is that the 2nd gen removes the need to have a hub.  I actually avoided smart devices like the Phillips hue that required a hub.  Now I don’t need to avoid them.

For the money this is a great device on its own.  I look forward to trying the 2nd gen with an additional plus and subwoofer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It came with the Echo and the directions say: To set up your free bulb, plug in and set up your Echo Plus, plug in your bulb, and ask, “Alexa, discover my devices."" All I get is ""no devices found"" even when turning on skill in the app. I have a hue account set up and logged in. If you try to join the Hue app itself it said ""no bridge found"". I asked Alexa  ""is Hub turned on"" and get no answer. I ask to ""turn Hub on"" same thing. I went and bought another HUE bulb and it does not work either.
 I bought this for THE HUB, but it does not seem to work. I'm sending back.

 On a side note most new home automation devices are WIFI now and do not need a hub. I just wanted to connect my older devices without an external hub.

I like the idea, but if I would make one of these I would have made a hub that worked and would have included Z-wave in the hub as well.

I'm sending back and ordering the ECHO without the hub. I also ordered a samsung gen 3 HUB to go with it and all will be good.

I do think the ECHO with the better speaker design is a great Alexa device. I love Alexa and everything the dot and Echo do, I just think the Built it hub didn't work out for them so well.

ADDITIONAL INFO:
 We even tried to connect our front door lock that was Zigbee and it would not connect in pairing mode. Tried several times and no luck. I think the HUB on the device I bought must be defective.

I have been working with home automation since the first generation and are very familiar with programming. We also set up out own alarm system and camera system with automation and garage door control.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

A pair of them would make for a much better overall music experience, as a single mono device just isn't ideal when it comes to enjoying music...  So, when the Echo Plus (2nd gen) arrived offering a built in stereo pairing feature/utility  via the Alexa app, I immediately jumped onto getting a set of them and traded in my original Echo.

The first let down was the sound.  The original Echo simply sounded a bit better.  It could go louder, and the sound was just clearer/cleaner.  Perhaps it is the quality of the materials used in the original Echo, which just seemed more like a premium device as to fit/finish and the richer sound.  Fine I thought - but certainly having a pair of the newer units would make up for a better overall Echo experience?  Well, no, not really.  Sound wise, even paired, I feel the original Echo just sounded cleaner/clearer.  The bass was less muddy and the dynamic range was also a bit better, especially at higher volume levels.  Now I'm not talking about a night and day differences here, but still, I fully expected the Echo Plus to have evolved somewhat in the sound department... and that simply isn't the case here.

So all in all, if you are looking to upgrade for improved sound, well, there isn't really any reason to jump ship.  Stick with your original Echo or explore the Sonus One speaker that has Echo support if you really want to upgrade your sound for music playback.

Now, my biggest gripe about the paired Amazon Echo Plus is the fact that it is ONLY paired for music playback.  Other than that, it acts as TWO completely separate devices.  This is especially frustrating in a kitchen environment where you use timers and alarms all the time.  Example:  Ask Alexa to set a 15 minute timer.  It does, choosing whichever Echo unit heard you I guess.  Now walk around the kitchen and then call out, ""Alex, how much time left on my timer?""...  And low and behold, the other unit hears you and responds telling you that you have no timers set!  WHAT?  With a stereo pair, you have to remember which device took your timer request and ensure that you are only speaking to it in order to get any info out of it?  Really?  How hard would it be to just have them act together in unison as one unit!?  Why not provide that as an option?  A paired set should behave and act as a single Alexa device!  They should respond in unison to commands - which they do not!  They should also know about each other timers/commands, but unfortunately they do not.  Right now, stereo pairing is NOT what I expected.  It only plays music in stereo paired setting, nothing else.  Rather than getting a nice volume boost when responding to commands, you get just a single speaker.  This is a tremendous let-down for having purchased two premium devices and wanting to use them together.  If Amazon would fix this MAJOR issue, I'd easily raise my review to 4 stars.  My original Echo was easily a 5 star device.  The newer Echo Plus (2nd Gen) is only a 3 star device if you buy 2 of them and use them as a stereo pair.  Purchased alone, I'd raise it to a 4 stars.  (-1 for the poorer sound quality compared with the original Echo).","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At that price, it's a steal.  I purchased the 2nd gen Echo about a month ago for my office and I liked it well enough, but I thought the audio was a little lacking.  I saw the Echo plus but the price (on sale) was $119 and I was hesitant to take the leap since the wife would likely be annoyed.  But then the Treasure Truck deal popped up and was too good to pass up.  I'm glad I grabbed it, as the sound really is improved.  I gave my daughter the Echo for her room and she's very happy, so all is well.

Other than the included Hue bulb, I don't have any other smart home items that work on the Zigbee system (everything else is WeMo, which has been solid), but it's nice that I can add Zigbee devices if they're the best deal in the future.  I also have asked about the temperature more times than I would have thought before I purchased it, though it doesn't tie into anything at the moment.  Hopefully they'll make it work with one or more of the smart thermostats at some point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is amazing, it’s truly a brilliant speaker as is.
The design is very elagant, it even has a tripod mount at the bottom, I don’t see myself using it, but it’s really nice that Amazon included this feature.
The built in hub saves you money so you don’t need to buy the Hue lights hub, and because it is built in, you don’t need 2 more annoying cables to hide or organize.

Alexa is Addictive. In a good way.
I bring the Echo Plus to my dorm in the army, I switched 3 dorm rooms in the past 3 months, and in every room, my teammates fell in love with her and asked me where can they buy it.
I think my most used commands are “Alexa, play my sleep playlist”, “set sleep timer for 30 minutes”, “lights off”. It’s amazing that I don’t need to even look at my phone at night or leave the bed to do all these actions, but I really hope that soon it will be possible to activate a series of actions like these 3 I mentiond, in one call.

Please note: Echo is amazing with Spotify and Apple Music, but without it, the Amazon Music library is your default, which is super frustrating because it has a very limited library of songs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1.  I bought the Echo Plus and Echo Dot which was delivered to the USA Address at Portland, Oregon.
2.  I brought back these two sets to Singapore for my family to use but when I registered for the Amazon Music using the Singapore Credit Card, it was rejected reasoning being that the Amazon Music only accept the USA Credit Card.
3.  Being the owner of the Amazon Echo Plus and Echo Dot, I hope that I would not be deprived from using the privilege offered by Amazon.
4.  One of the reasons that I purchased the two sets of Amazon Echos was the access to millions of music offered by Amazon.
5.  Therefore, I look forward to favorable reply from the Amazon Management.

I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again.  OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue.  Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks.  I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub.  Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running.  Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far.  So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone.  As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring.  Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review.  Really is a fun great product nice new Android App update is what I use as the main driver for home automation after giving up circa 1978 X10/BSR system till a few years ago. Why not 5 stars?  I'll save that for when the product reaches the hype. I purchased not for what it can't do now but what it can do in the future.

In the end I now have a bad Echo Plus, and a good Echo Plus. I was charged for the bad one too, even though I made multiple attempts to get a return label.

Immediately after the setup, we were disappointed that this new device was not nearly as loud as the Amazon Echo (1st Gen). While the Echo Plus looked terrific and sounded good, it still could not match the original version. We decided to pair the subwoofer with the Echo Plus, and it did help with the bass, but the overall volume was still not the same as the original Echo.  Along with the purchase of the Echo Sub Bundle, we also purchased the Echo Remotes for the ease of selecting our music. This turned out to be a nightmare. If you have a subwoofer paired with the Echo Plus, it overrules the paired remote which in turn makes the remote useless until the sub is unpaired from the device. The Echo Plus worked flawlessly with the remote when the sub was unpaired.

Some things are expected to get better as the generations progress but, in my opinion, not in this case. This appears to be one of those ""if it's not broke, don't fix it"" scenarios. Gen 2's and their lack of compatibility within its own genuine Echo add-on devices (sub and remote) makes me question what happened in the Gen 2's.

If you are looking for a clean sounding Echo without any extras, then this device will work just fine, and the sound is pretty good. If you are like us, hanging out listening to fairly loud music and using the remote so Alexa can hear you, this is not for you when paired with the sub.

I hope this helps. Good luck!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That alone is a great step-up.  I don't use the built-in bridge, so I cannot comment on that. One of the reasons I purchased this was for the built-in temp sensor and the ability to ask for the temp via voice. Having used two different units in two different locations (one in a different state), when I compare it to two other high-quality non-echo temp sensors that read within 1 degree of each other over a 24 hour period, the Echo Plus consistently measures about 5 degrees too cold day after day.  Disappointing execution of this feature.
I don't have an Echo (2nd gen) to compare the sound to, but perhaps you might better off saving money and buying that model instead because the temp is so inaccurate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

however, the speaker quality is amazing on this. I watched a few shows and it sounded like I was in a movie theater. there is a super slight delay though (I'm using the line in feature, something new I believe - super useful, should have always been a feature).

one last thing I find useful is the room temperature feature.

It's easy to place doesn't take much room. I can move it room to room and in most cases don't even need to move it because it can hear me. I am still reading, asking her and learning the particulars about all it does so I can't really answer technical details. I know we are Society of immediate gratification but just knowing what the time is without even looking or asking the temperature or weather outside and knowing in the moment has already saved me sometime.

I use it for everything and mostly listening to music. I ask Alexa what the temperature is inside and I can look on my Alexa app to get the temperature inside when I’m not home.

I can call anyone on it and walk around from room to room,
(within reason), and the person on the other end can still hear me speak. You will have to connect your Alexa app to call or text.

I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted.  I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally.  Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus).

I had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go.  I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love.  My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed.  This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy.

I have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features.

The only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Traill","These sound terrific!","November 23, 2018","The Amazon Echo Plus 2nd Gen is perfect for my needs - I bought 2 Amazon Echo Plus & the subwoofer (check my act. to read that review).  I have a large great room with 40ft ceilings and it absolutely fills my home with warm sound which can be heard throughout my house, and with the ""everywhere"" group feature I can successfully play my music throughout my home on my Echo's in stylistic fashion. I've been an audiophile for quite some time and this kind of quality for something affordable blew my mind.
I think my favorite feature is connecting this with smart home commands when paired with other devices - turning on lights, controlling my TV's, etc. It just makes everything so much simpler. I am highly anticipating future adaptability - the sky really is the limit with these devices. I would highly suggest these for your home as I have really enjoyed using them.
The only problem I've had so far is giving commands to play certain radio stations and the cursed ""I can't find (x)"" response. I really Alexa said something humorous when she can't find what I'm looking for, it would make it a lot less aggravating when I've been playing a Pandora or Amazon Music station and suddenly it can't find what I'm looking for.
Other than the minor nuisance of that, I am free to stream whatever station I want via Bluetooth on my iPhone or other smart pad, which negates my only discrepancy. My friends love interacting with Alexa when they come over!

When the subwoofer came out, it was not compatible with the first gen.  This smacks of planned obsolescence.  So I purchased this second gen to work with the subwoofer.  It is more compact, looks better and sounds better than the first.  With the subwoofer added, and some careful placement of the subwoofer, the sound is more than sufficient for a large family room.

PLACEMENT is the key to good sound.  If you stick these on a bookshelf, they sound horrible.  For the typical person out there looking for music in the house, this is great for the money.  Even though I am something of an audiophile, I can live with them as background music.  If I want to do any serious listening, I still have my dedicated music room.

I moved the first gen to the garage.  I just plunked it down on one of my rolling tool chests.  The first time I played music on it while working in the garage, I was floored.  It sounded so much better than it ever did in the house.  I am afraid to move it now for fear I will lose that sweet spot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Fixed problem next day with Service rep.  Great help","January 23, 2019","Pros:  Looks nice, has great sound.
Additional review: Was called by customer service next day, and went through a series of steps, including rebooting the modem.  After about an hour, Echo is up and running.  Customer service rep knew his stuff.
Cons;  Couldn't connect to the internet.  App won't download to my Ipad, says I have to update to 10.0 and not able to do that with my Ipad.  Downloaded the app to my android phone.  App kept connecting my phone to a unsecured network and stayed there until I physically switched it back. (OK today found that it was only connected to the Echo, not the internet) App kept telling me that the password for the internet was wrong...it was not, tried it several times, even went into the router to verify the PW.  Several times when the app kept telling me the PW was wrong it didn't bring up a place to change it.  Had to reinstall the app and hard reset the echo to get back to a screen to type in the PW.  Even in some of the areas where the internet was not needed there was a problem, after putting my phone number in it said that the number belonged to another account.  App not helpful, and it seems that the app is the only way to run this little gadget.
So, after about 5 hours of screwing with this frustrating little gadget it's going back.

Most of my home automation was handled by SmartThings.  With the addition of the new Plus, I have retired SmartThings and am slowing trying to have Alexa handle all of my HA tasks.  The major issue holding this back is that Alexa's support for sensors is brand new and not yet fully developed.  For example, the new Plus has a temperature sensors built in to it. But there isn't - currently, I hope - support for simply asking Alexa what the temp is in the room where the Echo Plus resides.

On top of which the features that are currently implements don't work so well.  I created a routine that was supposed to send me a notification any time the temp in my living room got below 65 degrees.  Just a simple routine to test how the temperature sensor is working.  It worked sort of.  I would get my notification but it would usually be delivered several hours after the trigger condition had been met.

Otherwise, the new Echo Plus seems to work well.  Discovering Hue light bulbs works seamlessly.  The sound is much better than my 1st gen Echo, even to my ancient ears.  It's smaller, better looking and so far, at least, does everything that it's supposed to do.  Amazon just needs a little more time to build out the software.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Sound quality is mediocre, significantly behind Sonos at $199.  The built-in hub is very limited with Philips Vue bulbs - can set only 15 colors instead of 16 million.  Settling on a difference of more than a million to one is difficult.  Decided to keep the Echo Plus, but purchased two Sonos, which do not contain hubs and are limited in their own right with Alexa due to being third-party units (i.e. no drop-in feature, nor ability to be part of multi-room music.)

The main takeaway is the $29 Amazon Echo Dot is a fantastic value with good overall acoustic performance, whereas the Echo Plus is not.  The extra cost for the improved speaker performance is not worth it, and the partially useful hub makes little sense.  So if money is less of a concern, order one.  But if you are on a tight budget, consider the Echo Dot without a built-in hub and only a marginal drop in acoustic performance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Jones","Alexa is nice - Smart Home is lacking","January 29, 2019","We're all having fun with Alexa.  Overall it is nice but I look forward to future updates.
Key areas -
Voice Profiles and security.  It would be nice if I could limit activity based on Voice profile.  While one can lock down purchases - I want to set times where Children aren't allowed to talk to it... or they can't override what Mom says (mom picks music and then the kids try to override mom - which results in me pressing the Mute button).  Alexa listens to everyone (future criminals will be yelling ""Alexa open the garage"" from outside the kitchen window)

SmartHome:  I bought the hub hoping I wouldn't need to buy a hub from other vendors.  Turns out I was wrong. Echo Plus doesn't support Scenes, sunset/sunrise time triggers, light switches as input, and several other things.  For example the Hue lights come on full brightness after a power outage.  The fix requires a Hue Hub.  Some switches I was looking at require their own Hub to operate.  You need the hubs and Alexa can control simple devices.  A hub of hubs (kind of an industry problem I suppose).

Miscellaneous - Timer alerts and CONTEXT.  We use this feature while cooking - often naming the timers ""chicken timer"" ""pasta timer""  wonderful feature.  However, when a timer goes off one can't simply say ""thanks I got it"" -- no you have to say ""Alexa - stop the pasta timer""  ""Alexa this, Alexa that"" - yes there is a mode to chain things together, but one still needs to be explicit as Alexa lacks context.  A time is going off - when I say stop --- take a guess what I might mean.

The larger speaker is nice (although my Sonos sound system is better -  the integration is lacking - but that's a Sonos problem).  It looks nice.  Works well.  Just needs new features added.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Well, guess who has enjoyed it the most and uses it every day? The young granddaughter! She has had a ball with this thing. She talks to it constantly! She asks it to meow like her cat, it tells her jokes, it reads to her, it sings songs, it sings science songs for heaven's sakes! I have been pleasantly surprised at the joy this young one gets from a talking machine! I don't know if it will cause trouble in the future, but she can play her favorite songs from my iphone just by asking for the title. These are songs that I approve of, as she lives with me, and it is nice to hear her sing along with them. She sets a timer at night and it sings her to sleep too. She has a favorite radio station, KLOVE, and she listens to that all the time too. I was scared at first, but I just knew that she loves texting, technology, and computers in general. This was a big hit with her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is the device you need if you are looking to start your smart home transformation. This smart hub allows you connect over 20k smart home items in one package. I personally use the Ring doorbell, Ring alarm system, Nest thermostat, Hue lighting, and several other items and it's all managable through the hub and Alexa. This makes it super convenient and it's nice to be able to adjust everything in one package by asking Alexa to do it. Also the difference from the 1st gen plus vs the 2nd gen plus are noticeable. The main differences are the sound guality, cosmetic appeal and a temperature sensor. Overall I love this item but remember the price brings the hub for smart home automation. If you just want Alexa then this device is not needed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But it has far too many bugs to be worth it anymore. It started just a few days after I received it. I had to do a factory reset because it got stuck on a notification that it couldn't play because it had disconnected from the internet, then it got stuck on a red ring immediately after. I had to delete everything I had worked to set up just a few days before in order to do the factory reset. It was working fine for a few weeks after that, then today it stopped playing my Spotify music, I had to relink my spotify premium account and reconnect the echo plus to the internet via set up mode, then it played spotify but could not access my playlists. When I asked ""Alexa, play my *name* playlist on spotify"" it would play a random playlist on spotify by the same name. Now is has unlinked from my spotify again, even though in the Alexa app it says I'm linked and good to go. I have given up.
30% of the time it will misunderstand me or not hear me at all, and I speak loud and clear in anticipation of it not hearing me correctly and it is in the center of the room so the microphones aren't blocked. I have overlooked most of these little bugs and brushed it off as this relatively new tech still finding its feet, but today's spotify fiasco was the last straw for me. It can still play NPR without a problem and is good at giving me generic information like the weather and time. Other than that, not worth the money I spent on it. It is now just a glorified radio in my living room. I’m giving it 3 stars because of what I can get it to do, it does very well. There are just too many bugs.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've been able to play with Echo Dot 2nd Gen, Echo Dot 3rd Gen, Echo 2nd Gen, and this in the same space. The Echo Plus bass is truly impressive for the size, and the only audio complaint I have is wishing its tweeter was a little more powerful. Mid to high-range piano notes, for example, ring louder from my Echo Dot 3rd Gen than from the Echo Plus, but that low vibration that fills the room is definitely dominated by the Echo Plus.

This thing also comes with an onboard thermometer, which is mostly what sold me. I know it seems like a trivial thing, but I really like the added ability to ask Alexa what the temperature is in that room. I don't know if the Zigbee Smart Home Hub part as been super useful to me. I do use it to control a bulb which was bundled with it, but most of my lights that I use are lamps, which are on smart plugs that work without this protocol anyway.

Overall, I'm super happy to have this nice smart speaker added to my Echo collection. It's a fine addition to the ""Play Music Everywhere"" sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Performance is quick, audio is great, and the built-in Zigbee hub works quite well.

Longer Review;

After dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.

When I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to ""replace"" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.

As you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit.

Setup;

Setup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that.

Audio compared to 2nd Generation Echo;

Highs are clearer.
Mids are more natural and better-defined.
Lows are deeper.
Overall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved.
When paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance.

General Performance;

We have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should.

I bought this with the ""free"" Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs.

Overall;

While $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try.

P.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I was so excited to see that this changed this year with the new generation... EXCEPT it doest work!! The alexa software that you need to configure it as a ""line in"" and not a ""line out"" doesnt function, and according to the tech that assisted me, this has been a common problem with the device. I bought it for this reason, as advertised by amazon, and it doest work. The options I were given by the tech was essentially to wait and hope it gets fixed in the future, return it and lose out on the black friday deal if it is fixed in the future and wanted to buy it again at that time once it is, or wait and waste $109 dollars if it isnt fixed in the future once I pass the return window. All for an issue that is 100% AMAZON'S FAULT!! FALSE ADVERTISING and HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE like I have never experience before from amazon from a problem THEY inflicted and CAN remedy if they choose too! I asked for an extended return window, if they can honor the black friday price if I was to return it and buy it again in the future, and a refund/discount on the product due to it essentially being defective for my purposes, and each request was flat out REJECTED.

Two Echo Pluses (2nd gen) placed 2.5m apart on a dresser (in the same room) with an Echo Subwoofer on the floor to the left of the dresser.

The two echo's often get confused and stop would as a single unit would.  If you say ""Alexa, do this"", sometimes the first Alexa replies and sometimes the second does.  The problem is that they do not necessarily realize that one has already replied.  If Echo one asks a question, sometimes Echo two hears the reply instead of Echo one causing Echo one to get stuck in a loop.

Sometimes the two echos break stereo sync and require HW power cycle to get it together.  One of the echo may lose the ability to ""Understand"" when in this state (this is NOT a wireless signal issue).

If you set a timer on these Echos, Echo one may set the timer and Echo two may then answer all other queries.  Echo two is not aware of timer on Echo one.  As such, Echo two cannot list, stop, or reset timers on Echo one even though they are ""one unit"".  A master/slave situation should exist when Echos are setup in stereo pairs (they are ONE unit).  Turning mute on one of the Echos helps, but the mute light is distracting and annoying.

In short, the sound quality gained by the stereo pair does not warrant the extreme annoyance of the buggy interaction when two Echos are placed 2.5m apart in the same room.

Amazon seriously needs to work on better detection code to determine which Echo I am talking to in a multi-Echo home setup.  Their implementation is horrid in close proximity (as above) and bad in simple multi-room use cases.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s great to be able to turn lights on and off by command, to play games, stream music, and do so many other things with these devices.  I’m hooked.

There is one major problem, though.  When I first bought my echo plus speakers, things were great.  About 2-3 days later, I linked my speakers together and gave Alexa a command to stop playing the music.  She hesitated, but followed through.  About a week later when I gave Alexa a command to end the music, she hesitated and then kept playing the music.  Um, hello, who’s in charge here?  So I gave the command again, louder.  Same response from Alexa.  I thought, “Dang, this girl likes her tunes!”  It wasn’t until I walked over to my speaker in the family room and gave the command to stop the music that the music finally stopped.  Had this not happened 3 separate times, I wouldn’t bother writing about it.  What’s the point in all of these microphones on this device if Alexa’s just going to ignore me and jam out to Lithium XM anyway?

If this stops being an issue, I will update my review and give a 5 star rating.  Right now, though, Alexa is kind of moody.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Bufe","Stereo feature needs updating","November 29, 2018","In the following examples, they are not stereo. Only one speaker plays.

1. Connect to your phone with Bluetooth. Play a video.
2. My Flash Briefing
3. Ambient sounds
4. Guided meditation
5. Line in from a stereo source such as a Dot (sometimes.)
6. Streaming music (sometimes).

Paired remote stops responding once stereo sound starts. Must use voice control. At times, only volume buttons respond from remote, not pause, mic, or anything else.

Sometimes, one stereo line into one of the echoes is enough to get stereo from both. Then it mutes entirely.  I pull the line from the echo plus left and reinsert it and the remote for that works again and there is sound, but only on one side.

Workaround: Use the Echo Pluses as dumb speakers. (It's a shame, I know, but this is hopefully just until they get the kinks worked out.)

Get a Dot. Mute mic on both Echo Pluses. Delete the stereo pairing in the Alexa app. Change Line In/Out jacks to In in the settings for each. Use a left/right breakout cable going from the Dot mini stereo jack to one cable for each Echo Plus. The remote works with the Dot at all times as it should. Stereo sounds proper in stereo test videos on YouTube via Bluetooth from the phone. (But there is an irritating lag.) News and other apps play from both speakers (even if mono).

This workaround won't help to utilize the subwoofer, unfortunately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased the plus model for the “premium sound” and the array microphones because I wanted the best sound and recognition. Unfortunately, this falls short by a long run. Alexa barely can hear any request, always telling me she doesn’t recognize lights because she can’t  hear hue, or she just beeps and doesn’t do or say anything. Also, asking her to play music is a very difficult task. She will just play a random song that is nowhere near what you said. Running in to the sound quality, it sounds like a single cheap built in TV speaker. It can barely make a presence in a 12 x 14 bedroom. My 3 year old JBL flip is 3x louder which is smaller and runs on battery and sounds way better in highs mids and low frequency. The JBL doesn’t even have a dedicated tweeter like the echo does. I have friends who have the original echo and it has way better sound.

Overall this is definitely a bad buy for the $150 it was. Probably will return it and get a different brand for at least $50 cheaper.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

.
Then I startef fooling around with it and now I have three with probable two more on the horizon.
.
You only need one ""Plus"" because they talk to each  other - but you need that plus so they can all use it to turn smart light bulbs on-and-off and do other WiFi/Zigby stuff.
.
Smart devices, Pandora, my own music via the Plex add-on...I find it addictive AND functional.
.
Three Nice-To-Haves so far:
- Custom wake-up words.  ""Alexa"" gets on my
  nerves, ""Computer"" is a bit of a mouthful.
  Being from Philadelphia,  I'd opt for ""Yo!"".
- More granularity in volume commands: 3 is a
  bit too soft and 4 is a bit loud. (you only get
  10 volume levels at this time).
- Multi-processing.  Right now, it only does one
  thing at a time so, if you have it playing music and
  tell  it to turn a light off, the music has to stop for
  several seconds while it issues the lightbulb
  command, the bulb responds, and the Echo
  issues it's ""Command successful"" beep.
.
Favorite Command: ""'Puter: Shut up"" (actually, ""'Puter Shut"" works too)...and it realky does shut
up immediately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've got to say that in addition to its capabilities as a Zigbee hub, the sound is better than my previous generation Echo products.

As a result, I've placed this unit in our living room, where we use it not only to command our many home-automation lights and appliances, but listen to NPR and Spotify.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I usually use it for my music Bluetooth compatible because I use Apple Music I can tell Alexa next and she will play the next song. Also use it for my lights and TV to turn on and off.

Let me say, if you consume ANY media at all; music movies podcasts etc this speaker is WORLDS better than even the newest echo dot 3rd gen. The bass is VERY present without actually vibrating everything the kids and the highs follow right behind. This thing FILLS the room with music and I love it.

Speaker will not allow me to put it into any groups in the Alexa app. It does not accept control from the Alexa app when I tell press pause or try to get it to stop/start playing music. The app usually claims this speaker cannot be reached.

Has the built in hub and within minutes of turning it on for the first time our house turned into a smart house. Set up for light bulbs and outlets was a breeze. Alexa reminds us and helps us with all sorts of stuff! The App is so easy to use too.  So many things we are doing with it now and every day we find new ways to have her help out! I love this and now have dots in just about every major living space in the house and the Echo Plus in the kitchen.
The intercom feature is great for my teen who loves to shut her door and listen to music on the end of the house. I highly recommend the Echo Plus. Sound quality is perfection as well!!

Bonus: My five year old was not listening to me before the bus one morning. Instead of getting upset, I decided to set a reminder for 1 minute. One minute later Alexa came on and said she should put on her jacket and boots like your mom said or she will notify Santa that she was not being a good listener.

Also not able to use these for smart TVs either.  So basically these are glorified devices for playing online content.  I don't get why they would roll these out without those features.  The Echo Plus stereo pair and sub  I ordered are scheduled to arrive tomorrow, but in light of that glaring omission, I will return them and just wait for the 3rd Gen and hopefully they will be blue tooth/smart tv compatible.  Sadly, they will probably be rather costly for the addition of features they should have included in the first place.  Mia culpa as I should have looked at these reviews before I ordered them.  I will be happy to change my review when they fix this issue.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Glenn","Line In feature doesn't work","December 6, 2018","OK, so generally I like the Echo Plus.  However, there are several things I don't care for so much:

First, the ""Line In"" feature doesn't work.  I've contacted Amazon support and they've said a fix is on the way, but I don't have an ETA on that so for now I'm only giving this one star.  This is because the primary reason I purchased this device over others was the fact that it offered a Line In feature, which my wife wanted to be able to use our old iPod to connect it to the speaker.  This is a pretty big defect, especially when it is advertised as a distinguishing feature.

Second, getting Alexa to recognize requests for specific albums is difficult.  The phrasing has to be precise, otherwise she'll respond that she can't find the requested album and proceed to suggest something ""similar"".  This wouldn't be so bad except usually I don't want to listen to something ""similar"" and I'm not so sure the suggestions are always good.  This problem isn't so much unique to Alexa as I have similar issues with my google home, but google seems to be more responsive.  I just don't like having to talk over Alexa to get her to stop talking so I can move on.  I also find Alexa to be a bit more cold than my google home assistant, perhaps a little more robotic.

I do like that the Echo Plus seems more responsive to my voice compared to the Google Home.  Perhaps the mic is better in the Echo Plus than the Google Home.

Sound quality is OK and is comparable to the Google Home.

The ""smart"" light bulb that comes with the Echo Plus is only ""OK"".  It was easy to set up, but I was disappointed that it couldn't do anything more than turn on/off and dim (I was kind of hoping for the ability to change colors).  It also took me a bit of time to find a use for the bulb.  Needless to say the use cases for a ""smart"" light bulb seem limited.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Doesn’t work. Frustrating.","January 29, 2019","At first I bought one echo and loved it. The music was my favorite. After realizing I had to sign up for music unlimited on top of my prime membership I thought it was too much! Luckily you can sign up with an echo and only pay 3.99 a month for unlimited.  So I signed up and i was happy! Looked into multi room music and read a lot of good reviews so I went ahead and got more echos... 2 new plus ones and 5 echo dots plus a product red echo previous gen.... I set it up and it was a total pain.... it worked for a day or two and now it lags completely it doesn’t turn up the volume it’s just terrible..... now it’s telling me I can’t pkay music in this music group because I have to upgrade!!!????!!!???!!? What!!!???? It’s beyond a waste of your money. I loved and respected Amazon but this is a slap in the face.... 5 echo dots and 3 echo plus is a lot of f6363g money! It caused trouble in my household too... convinced my partner it would be great and of course it has been a terrible experience..... everything about my experience has had issues.

Had to be sent a replacement. Had to be sent ANOTHER replacement...none of the problems were fixed (systemic to the device) and have just given up. What are the problems? Let me count the ways:

1. The ""Line In"" (the reason I got this; in order to be a speaker for my small bedroom TV). It kept glitching to Line Out for no reason, then for three weeks couldn't be turned back to Line In (making the item unusable as a TV speaker). Turned out it was a software problem, which was eventually fixed...but it still will randomly switch from Line In to Line Out for no reason.

2. With a cable from the TV to the Line In of the Echo Plus, the lag/sync is off. Always. It's infuriating, as there's no way to fix it. Reboots, shut downs, replacement device (which they swore, twice, would fix it), nothing fixes it. I can watch TV, but it's always irritating. Worse, if I use Bluetooth earbuds/headphones to listen, the lag is so far out, it's like watching a badly dubbed foreign film. I've just given up on this.

3. Completely random and total unworkable voice response, or lack thereof. One moment I say ""Alexa, do..."" and it works. A moment later if I try. Nothing. No light to say it's heard me. Nothing. It'll then work for no reason later, or not. It NEVER works first thing in the morning. It's infuriating and makes voice control completely useless as there's never a consistent answer to a voice command since it never responds. I've trained the voice, rebooted, had three of them...it's something specific to the Echo Plus. My Echo Dot is fine. If I sync to my bluetooth earbuds in the morning, that seems to ""wake"" it up...but only for an indeterminate time. It's infuriating.

4. With that in mind, I'm sure people ask: ""Why not just use the Alexa app on your iPhone or iPad to turn on lights/fans/etc.? Ha! To get the app up and connected it takes...wait for it: over a minute at times. Now, my Lumiman light bulbs that I want to turn off/on through Alexa? No hope through their software, but Lumiman's software is instantaneous. Always works. No wait.

I wish I could just get my money back and I'd get a small speaker (I was going to, but thought this would kill two birds with one stone). This has been a totally awful experience and now a waste of money.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was a Nightmare to have them connected as stereo output. Had to delete and reassign them a couple of times for it to work.

Sound quality is ok on the echos
What you expect from them. The subwoofer really does make a difference to your music.

Now here is my real issue. It only allows you to play stereo music through amazon music app or if you tell alexa. Which is unnaceptable because their apo is garbage and laggy. Sometimes it plays stereo and sometimes it only plays it through one echo and no subwoofer.
Cant stream from another source or just connect your phone to the stereo source which I hope they fix in an uodate.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Those that have followed these devices over the past year or two know that the latest Echo Plus is now shorter, a little wider and comes with a 33% improvement in tweeter speaker size and a 20% size improvement with the woofer.  Those and other improvements you can read about in their literature make for a better sounding product.  If you enjoy music, the Plus is the best Echo product to buy.

I have also taken full advantage that the hub feature provides by having sound on all devises at the same time playing one of the fifty playlists I've created on Amazon Music.  Also every room in the house has a smart bulb that Alexa can turn on or off individually or collectively or you can use the Amazon Alexa app. It also controls the smart plugs we have.  Besides the Echo Plus playing music on demand the hub feature is a real bonus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So I have an Echo in the Bathroom - perfect for bathroom speaker- why would you need more in the bathroom?  I have Spots in both my bedrooms - Set alarms, Bluetooth to TVs, picture albums, check the weather, play sleep sounds, etc - basically a high powered alarm clock. Echo Show in the kitchen. I get my updates, calendar, weather, and sound - perfect. I have a (Un-supported) Tap on the back porch. Still great sound, but basically it has just become my ""portable"" speaker - which works for me. I can take it into the garage or out front to wash my truck - still love it, and recommend buying cheap. You cannot include it as part of the smart home, but you can talk to Alexa and listen to Amazon Music on it, and still turn your smart bulbs on and off. Lastly, I bought the new Echo Plus for my living room. For me the selling point was the built in thermometer. I was wrong thinking that was the only selling point. This speaker is awesome!!! Do not buy 2, plus the woofer for ""full"" sound. This speaker takes over my entire house. Granted, my two Spots, my Echo, and my Echo Show were turned down, but even still if I play music on the everywhere group, this speaker dominates my entire house - plus it is Bluetoothed to my living room TV. I want something for my dining room, and have not figured out exactly what device I want yet, but as I sit here and do research, the Echo Plus is bouncing into my dining room (around the corner) and keeps making me think it is my Tap that is playing.

No, really, I welcome my personal assistant overlords. My family is pretty vanilla. So it only creeps me out a little when my husband and I have ""test"" discussions about things we don't talk about, don't search the internet for, and would never actually buy in a million years only to see such items pushed to us in advertising feeds. Is one of our assistants listening when it is supposed to be asleep? If so, which one? All three of the majors are in our house. Both of the cats have turned Siri on by walking across my laptop. And Alexa hears her name sometimes inexplicably. Maybe it's my husband's Long Island accent?

Or maybe it is just randomness and the assistants are functioning as advertised. Either way, I won't be getting rid of them anytime soon. The Echo Plus recognized all but two of my smart bulbs and found all of my switches and everything else that still works (old WeMo stuff went offline over a year ago when Belkin pushed a firmware upgrade and killed their wifi connections). It has controlled them flawlessly so far, and this has allowed me to free up the ethernet ports I'd dedicated to several different hubs.

My Echo devices are the ones we use most around here, both because the house runs on Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save (I have lupus and cannot easily shop in the real world) AND because the Echos allow me to reach my teenager and tell him things whether he wants to hear them or not. He can ignore my texts and refuse to answer the phone, but Alexa lets me yell at him from anywhere in the world. (And the app lets me see his history of ridiculous teenaged boy questions - unlike Siri, Alexa is not a potty mouth and does not like it when you are.)

On the downside, Alexa won't give you suggestions if she doesn't know something. She just gives you an Elizabeth Jennings (The Americans) type, ""Hmmm,"" and a disappointed note.

The Echo Plus also seems to ""hear"" better and have fewer false activations. And the sound is better for music - by a surprising amount. So, if Alexa has a place in your home, the Echo Plus is a good way to get her. Four stars. I'd give five if the wake word were more customizable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

better sound
Bass Treble control
Built in thermostat
The hub is nice but really bought for the other extras
Cons: light ring isnt as bright this year, brightness adjusts with toom light
Ex: dims with low light (not to bother you while you sleep I guess) brightens up in normal light but still not as bright as last generation.

I immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality, mainly in more bass.  The down side is that I also noticed that the 2nd Gen has trouble hearing or understating some things which the 1st Gen did not. Both version have 7 microphones built-in, so I can't figure out why we sometimes have to speak louder for the 2nd Gen model to hear or understand us...?  For instance, my son's name is ""Kellen"" and I have a room light plug under his name and a playlist for him on Amazon Music, but Alexa for some reason can't understand the name and keeps saying I can't find ""Calvin's Playlist""...?

In conclusion, the improvement in the design aesthetic and sound quality is a thumbs up, but the interaction experience seems to have taken a downgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Even after adjusting the 3 audio adjustments for lower, mid and high range, the audio from this speaker is muffled and sounds terrible.  I have a original 1st gen Echo still working that theoretically should sounds slightly inferior due to smaller speakers - but it is far better.  It's not that I am very picky about audio, this speaker actually has a strange aspect to the muffled sound that could not simply be created by increasing bass and lower highs and mids.

MICROPHONES NOT AN IMPROVEMENT OVER DOT
The microphones also are not an improvement of a Dot 1st gen, and then later a Dot 2nd gen that this unit replaced.  This new speaker is in the kitchen near the stove, replacing the prior Dot's that lived in the same spot.  The Dot's did not do very well picking up voice - sometimes not at all, and sometime just very wrong. There is more background noise and white noise sometimes in the kitchen (exhaust hood), and I had hoped that this top-end speaker would be better at ""listening"" than the low-end dots; it isn't.

 I'll be returning this for either credit or for a different model altogether.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amazon keeps sending emails telling what yo can ask for, bucause it is not always so obvious.  Also, this is absolutely not premium sound.  They think very bassy is premium!  And the equalizer controls are only somewhat useful.  Difficult to get amazon purchaseed music from my wife’s account with her as a household member.  Still figuring it out.

I have a Bose, which always outperformed other small sound systems for me, but the Echo 2nd Gen--although individually not quite as good soundwise as Bose--sounds just as good when the two speakers are paired, and along with the subwoofer slightly outperform the Bose. The trebles are clear and the bass isn't overwhelming, but it's a good solid sound and feel. There's a good balance between treble and bass and you can ask Alexa to decrease or increase both. The volume level can also get extremely loud, which I found has been lacking in most speakers this size. The setup can be a little glitchy with the Alexa app, which seems buggy and is not that user friendly when it comes to setting up and pairing, but even I, who is no tech wiz, was able to figure it out and finally pair everything up. I've tried so many  small speakers like this and have always been disappointed, so I'm glad I finally found some that live up to my expectations. Super happy I bought these. I'll definitely be keeping them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Brandt","Nice sound","October 18, 2018","Not that the sound of the ""old"" 1st Gen Echo was bad, but the 2nd Gen is noticeably better. Deep, richer and perhaps even louder than the old. I did like the old volume control (turning the top of the device) as opposed to buttons (so 1990s), but since I rarely use that function, I can live with it. The only down I can think of is the ""smart home hub."" I don't know what it is, how to use it, whether it can replace the ones I already own, or where to find information about it. I posted a question pre-sale, but never got a response. Maybe no one know, or perhaps it is not ready for prime time.

BTW, I ""traded in"" the old one for a credit and it was worth the investment just because the sound is superior.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was pulled in my the slick marketing about the sound.  The older Echo Plus has more resonance and crisper upper range and far less distortion.

It also took considerable time to get the 2nd Gen to sync with devices on my network.  With Hue Lights, I had to delete them and start over again.  Everything is working fine now, but it took a couple hours of troubleshooting to get there.

If you have the original Echo Plus smart home hub and you like it, keep it.

I purchased the bundle that came with a HUE light bulb. The built in Zigbee hub in the Plus allows you to control the lightbulbs right out of the box. We only plan on having about 10-15 bulbs connectrd around the house so we shouldn't need more than the built-in hub for our needs. The sound is superb- we like it better than our old BOSE systems we used to use with our smart phones! Set up through the Alexa app did take a few attempts to connect to our wifi--but once we had it all up and running we've had no issues. We will be adding additional Echo's for other rooms. Asking for the time and the weather and turning on/off lights is very helpful. It was also very easy to add access to our Apple Music account in the app so we can play our favorite podcasts & music from there too.

It would be great if one could switch on a loudness control for the sound volume.that would automatically increase the base as one lowers the volume.

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. ECHO PLUS EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!!
No JOKE!! I don't even miss my Bose speakers. I use ECHO PLUS ALL THE TIME NOW. everything they advertised is TRUELY ACCURATE.
""PREMIUM ROOM FILLING SOUND"" - OKAY Amazon you got that right!
I am very happy with this purchase.
Not only with Brilliant speakers, it has transform my home into smart home and I don't even have to get Hubs for light bulbs.

on the flip side, I am returning my echo spots because the sound quality is disappointing. Will use that return money to purchase either am Echo Show or my 2nd Echo Plus.

Neither of them ever move. But the bluetooth won't stay connected and won't pair again without unplugging the Echo first. Only to disconnect the bluetooth again halfway through playing a song on Amazon music.
Also, every two or three days the Echo becomes completely unresponsive and has to be unplugged and replugged.
On Amazon music, the Echo will skip ahead to the next song at random intervals. Or stop playing music altogether after about 4 songs.

Not only does the speaker sound way too bass heavy, but it drops audio multiple times a day on my Everywhere network.

I don't believe that it's an internet connectivity issue as I have excellent wi-fi with only a few devices connected, the plus is only 8 feet away from the modem, and none of my dots in other rooms have any issues. I have tried resetting it, moving it within feet of the modem, different streaming sources, etc It keeps dropping audio no matter what. Meanwhile, if you ask it what's playing (and it understands you for a change), it will tell you what's playing, but no music comes out.

Also, of all my echo devices, the echo plus has the worst comprehension by far! Per other reviewers, I've moved it down to a coffee table and made sure that it wasn't trained to my voice, but it still fails to understand virtually every instruction!

We always have music playing while my wife and I are cooking or relaxing in our garage or really just about anything going on at the house. I did get two echo dots to pair with this plus. The ability to pair all three and have the multi room experience is a huge game changer. The plus has amazing highs and bass response. With the dots paired, the sound is so rich. We did get a free trial for amazon music and after using it the past week, I have cancelled my Pandora and keeping the amazon music. We can hear a considerable difference in sound quality. The library is endless. My family definitely gives this a high 5 star rating.

We do have 2 Bose speakers that we would use and always fighting for which phone is connected. Which is why I got the idea of getting these speakers. No need to fight over Bluetooth connects anymore. The price point is spot on and very good quality. I am considering getting the amazon subwoofer but the boss at home said not now.

I’ve never owned any products with Alexa and she has surprised us in a great way. Alexa is so fun and the routines I’ve set up are always great. My kids love the stories and jokes she tells.

All in all, I recommend the plus and follow up with a couple of dots to add that extra enjoyment. It’s sound quality is amazing sealed up in a compact design. The cloth exterior adds a classy touch to our kitchen and bedroom.

If someone can find a way to make these portable, that would definitely be a huge deal at our house. That’s the only thing that I had an issue with but I guess a little sacrifice for now will do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Otherwise it’s use is limited.","October 18, 2018","All echo units do not communicate among themselves.  For example you have to add reminders or routines individually on each eco unit. We hope the future software updates consider this improvement.  Additionally eco does not directly communicate with Ring Security System, not the ring door bell system in order to facilitate command turn on and turn off of the security alarm system.  This comes handy to command eco to turn off ring security system when the door is accidentally opened. This is specifically requested because Amazon recently acquired the ring security system.

Bilal","The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where.","October 25, 2018","There are many bugs in the product that requires correcting, so I am happy to hear Amazon say Alexa is always learning. The Bluetooth connection breaks up when connecting to a my Macbookpro Bluetooth speaker. Invocations for Skills do not always work for some developers and Alexa does not pick up on this issue and recommends actions that is not related to the command.  When sending a command to open a radio station on one of the radio channels Alexa does not recognize the command and continuous to open to incorrect station.  Even though I send feedback to the app to indicate that it was the incorrect station, I continue to get the same results.  The system is not learning my most frequent commands.  But the sound is great, the system is practical for timing and mathematical conversions, the list function is GREAT! The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where.  Once you learn the way to structure commands and where it should come from (i.e. Skills, Amazon Music...etc.) you can make good use of it. There were basic search engine requests given that Alexa didn't know.  This makes me wonder what search engine or data base is it pulling information from.  There shouldn't be any different between typing in the Google Search Engine and getting a result and asking Alexa a questions and getting a similar result.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So our kitchen, dining room and bedroom had two speakers taking up space, the Echo and the Bose. Now the New Generation Echo devices with their new speakers are so very good plus so very small that we decided removed our Bose speaker from the dining room. In the kitchen and bedroom, we bought the Echo Shows which they also have great sounding speakers.  We almost bought the Sonos One with Alexa, but after comparing them side by side in a show.  We bought the Amazon Echo devices based on the equally sound and the better price. We paid $69 for the Echo, $99 for Echo Plus and not $199 for the Sonos. The Echo Shows, We paid $179 which was still cheaper than the Sonos One.  Now don’t get us started on the new Bose 500 with Alexa at $399, which barely sound better than the New Generation Echo devices and definitely not worth $300 more.  Remind you we own a lot of Bose products and have been fans since 1980. So my recommendation is buy The New Generation Echo Devices over the over priced and marginally better sound Bose 500 is a based on years of use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Dont Be ... BUY THIS ECHO","October 15, 2018","I jumped on the Echo bandwagon as soon as the original was released a few years ago.  Loved it.  When the Echo Plus with Built in Hub was released in 2017 … Nice.  The hub gave me the luxury of controlling my garage door after buying Nexx Garage.  With these two Echo's - I also purchased the Amazon Voice Remote because the Echos did not have much range for ""listening"" around corners and from different rooms.  The Voice Remote was essential, but solved the issue.  I also added an Echo Dot in an obscure corner of the house for better Alexa coverage.

When the Echo Plus with ZigBee (2nd Generation) was released in October 2018 … I stressed over whether I should take the plunge and add another.  Would it be ""that"" much better?  I DID buy it and I am soooooooo glad about my decision.
PROS:  #1 - Pairing accessories with this latest version is easy and intuitive.  Everything works flawlessly.  My previous two Echos had me ranting in frustration when trying to add a smart home device. And most ended up being returned out of failure to pair.  #2 - The internal microphone is so finely tuned - I can call out commands from other rooms and even outside the house (when the windows are open) and Alexa responds perfectly.  #3 - THE SPEAKERS.  Oh the sound is phenomenol !!  Yet - I was going to call Amazon support because there was a ""rattle"" sound frequently from the speakers/unit when playing music.  I went next to the unit to record the ""rattle"" so I could play it for the tech rep when I called.  It was them that I realized the speakers were so dynamic - they were rattling my fine glassware that was in close proximity to the Echo.  Once the glassware was moved - the speakers are sensational and flawless.  I play Spotify all the time now.  It sounds wonderful on the new Echo !!!

This 2nd Generation Echo is worth every penny and then some.  I now have my entire house paired with receptacles, light bulbs, my garage door opener and a Phillips Color Hue bulb.  Pairing and grouping everything was absolutely simple !!!  There is never a glitch in operating the accessories.  AND best of all - I know what I will be buying for family holiday gifts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I use this product for streaming music, setting alarms, requesting information, building grocery/to-do lists & all the other things most people utilize the device for.  The best function for me has been using the device to control home automation.  I have smart plugs, smart thermostat, smart locks & smart bulbs that I easily/quickly control with voice commands to Alexa.  It is so convenient to get into bed and say ""Alexa, turn of bedroom light""  or to wake up in the middle of the night hot and say ""Alexa, decrease temperature by 3 degrees"".  This product has changed my life, making it more productive, efficient and FUN!!!  BTW, you can intercom within your house if you have multiple Alexa devices.

The Echo works. Realistically it’s not expensive. It’s simple. There are times the Echo doesn’t pick up, even in quiet areas (which can be annoying). Did I stutter Alexa? Maybe. Overall I’m happy with the product. I would like to see the mobile application improved. It can be laggy and unresponsive. But for the Echo device itself, it does its job. Don’t expect “booming” bass or “orchestral pit” mids/highs, but it isn’t the worst speaker in the world. If you’re looking to improve the sound, they have an Echo Sub you can add. I’ll be doing that in the near future. As of right now, I don’t regret not going with Apple’s HomePod.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Note that I did this solely for music; I have no smart devices in my home so I did not buy this to control lights, locks, etc. The sound IS better but it is not the big full sound I am looking for. I determined I definitely want a system with more than one speaker for the stereo effect.

What was frustrating to me was dealing with Alexa; there were too many communication  problems. My first Alexa knew music that the new one didn't but perhaps that was due to communication as well. Alexa also sometimes talked or started playing music when I did not address her which was a little creepy.  Sometimes I would have to get up close to the Echo and speak my words slow-ly-and-dis-tinct-ly for her to understand what I wanted. As a result of these issues combined with wanting a bigger sound I decided to return the Plus.

I am a 67-year-old man trying to catch up on technology and it has been interesting to me to see so many other 'boomers' on here trying to do the same thing. Purchasing the two Echo speakers entered me into this whole Bluetooth-wireless-WiFi world that I knew nothing about, and I have learned a lot. Still much more to learn but at least I have a better understanding. I will re-visit the wireless speakers in the future and maybe they will have some of the Alexa bugs worked out.  But for now I will be content to listen to SeriusXM.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The two in the kitchen/living area are paired as a stereo.  I found that the separation between the two Echo's is a bit spotty at times when paired as a stereo.  Still trying to figure out a way to pair them both with the sub without them playing as a stereo.  I think getting the full range out of each Echo would sound better.  The sound quality gets spotty (pun intended) as you increase the volume.  Two Echo's and a sub are not a replacement for a high end sound system obviously.  But the convenience is nice being about to group areas on the different speakers/zones and have music everywhere in the house.  I do wish a equalizer was available in the Alexa app for each speaker.  I know the ability is there to achieve this with the technology that is in the Echo plus but Amazon has apparently decided not to provide that capability.  Since I have a home office my attempts to mesh Alexa and Cortana (Windows 10) have been a bit frustrating.  Although that is a skill that Alexa has -Cortana still needs work on the Microsoft end and it would be nice if Amazon and Microsoft provided a more fluid work productivity venue for the millions of us that work out of home offices.  There is good potential there but it just has not been realized yet by the developers that seem content with Alexa telling jokes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I will say in general that it looks cool, sounds fine (maybe a 5 out of 10 compared to real speakers), the music playing capabilities are excellent with Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify, and the voice recognition is ok - good not great. I had no problem connecting to a Phillips Hue bulb and eventually an Echo dot and a smart outlet. I use all the time to play music and radio, control lights, and make shopping lists. I bought on sale at the end of 2018 for $97.99 which I think was a great deal.

That said, I want to focus in on a four major issues that I wish I’d known about before buying:

1. Podcasts
There is no native podcast skill on Alexa so you need to get podcasts through TuneIn, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, etc. All my other devices (computer, mobile) are Apple products where I use the Podcast app to listen and sync. The podcasts I listen to are not all on any one of these skills so I would need to download all the ones I need to keep podcasts synced between Alexa and my iPhone which is too much trouble. Plus I have a heck of the time trying to tell Alexa what podcast I want to listen to - who remember the episode titles or  numbers of the podcast they are currently listening to? Even just asking it to play the latest episode of a podcast wasnt’t working for me 9/10 times so I just gave up and figured I will connect my iPhone over Bluetooth when I want to continue a podcast. But that brings me to my next issue:

2. Bluetooth connections
I was successful at pairing the Echo to both my iPhone and iPad but Alexa can’t connect to the one I want when I ask it to. If I ask to “connect to my iPhone”, it connects to my iPad. If I ask it to “connect to my phone”, it still connects to my iPad. The only way to get it to connect to my iPhone with a voice command is to turn Bluetooth off on my iPad - annoying!

3. Multiple users
This is a big one. It is great that the Echo can have multiple users on it, so my wife and I can share the Echo using our separate accounts (which are linked in Prime). You can even set it up to recognize each of your separate voices. However, ONLY THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT CAN CONTROL THE SMART HOME DEVICES. This means that if I want to control the lights and the Echo is set to use my account, I have to tell it to switch to my wife’s account first, then give it a command for the lights. Furthermore, you have command it to switch between accounts to use your personal skills and settings. Given that it can recognize my voice as distinct from my wife’s, I thought that if I asked to play something on Pandora, it would automatically play from my account. Nope - I need to tell it to switch from my wife’s account to my account, and then ask it to play something on Pandora. Want to turn the lights down? Have to switch back to my wife’s account. Want to play something else on my Pandora? Have to switch back to my account first. What is the point of having voice recognition if it can’t automatically detect who is speaking and use that person’s account? And what is so useful about having multiple accounts if they can’t both control the smart home devices? And last, there are some things I would like to be discrete to my account only - like shopping lists and reminderss - but those have to be shared, so my wife’s Alexa app on her phone is getting reminders that I set up. There are some major kinks here they need to work out, but the good news is that it’s all just software fixes so GET ON IT AMAZON!

4. Routines
Another big one here. There is a well-documented glitch that people experience with Echos where the music stops playing after one song. You have to ask it to keep playing in order to keep going to the next song. If you google “echo stops playing” you will see lots of discussion around this. Well we had it happen to us as soon as we set up routines. Routines are little scripts you can set up - actions Alexa can take when certain criteria are met. This is one of the primary reasons we went with the Plus instead of the Dot. We have pets in the house and we wanted to set up a routine where the Echo would send us an alert if the house temperature got above or below a certain amount. Well unfortunately as soon as we set up the routines, the Echo started doing the thing where it stops playing after one song. So we deleted the routines and reset the Echo and the problem has not come back. But now I am afraid to set up any routines because I don’t want to deal with the music playback issue. I hope they fix this glitch because not having routines is a big drawback.

5. Alexa Guard
I was also excited to learn that the Alexa Guard feature can alert you if it hears broken glass or smoke alarm sounds. But it’s not available yet. Still waiting for that.

If I knew someone interested in buying an Echo, I would recommend they try an earlier generation Echo Dot which you can get on craigsist for $20-30 and see how you like that before spending $150 on the latest Echo Plus. Too many bugs still need to be fixed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Being able to use the Alexa App's equalizer to adjust the sound to my ear and the room is a big plus, and now I don't have to rely on other blue-tooth speakers to be able to ""feel"" the music.

It's very responsive (almost too responsive if you don't mute it whenever anyone on TV is demonstrating how they work) has great sound quality and is very easy and intuitive to set up. There are literally thousands of things it can do for you and you're really only limited by your imagination. Usually the Echo or the Echo plus is bought and used for the main hub of an Echo/Alexa enabled Smart home, although there are other more expensive options like the Echo Show that can do everything the Echo Plus can do plus a few things the Echo plus can't. If you are on a tight budget and don't need a video interface though then the Echo Plus is the Smart Home hub for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pro: Quality Built, Quality Sound, Functionality, Small form factor, Volume (low and high), Perfect amount of Base

Cons: Connecting all three to act like a system is finicky and dosen't work when you set it as an alarm.  Only will play off one so you miss out on some of the rich sound when waking up.  But a plus since it isn't as loud.

Long Review:
I have to say these are amazing.  I have had a lot of amazon products and these surprised me the moment I started them up.  First off these get loud for their size and the audio clarity is amazing.  They are crisp, clear and sound amazing.  Now if you like heavy heavy base then these aren't the speakers for you.  I bought the package with 2 speakers and the sub and they are perfect for me.  The base is well controlled and gives the sound that is lacking in many speakers but if you want the base to shake the walls and make it sound like a floor speaker with a 12 inch amplified drum then don't try.  But if you are looking for a clean, rich, bold and sophisticated listening experience then these are amazing.  Much better than anything I have tried in the $350 price point.

If you want something that is loud, base heavy with good high and mid tones better than this then look at spending 700 or more.  I listen to everything from classical music to EDM, Rock, rap, pop, country, jazz and folk and these just keep impressing me.  The vocals aren't drowned out and you can hear all the instruments and the base fills in the lows at the perfect listening experience.

Summary:  If you are looking for rich, deep, bold music this is the set for you.  Better than anything in the 350 to 450 market.  (I have tried 20 in this market) If you are looking for wall pounding, rave quality base then you better live on your own or in a frat house cause more than this you will need a floor speaker with amplifier and thick walls.  PS I own a full amplified speaker set housed in my living room for when I was in college and a fraternity.  Nothing against them but horrible for all day listening and having friends over to talk and not drink all day haha

Note: I have both echos and the sub in my bedroom and the room is too small for all 3.  I barley raise the volume past level 3, maybe 4 if I am listening to them in the shower.  I moved them to my living room for the pre and post Superbowl party and they filled a medium 4 bedroom 3 bath house with crystal clear music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

So far the sound quality is much better than the google mini as expect. I have it centrally located in my house and it disperses the music nicely. The receive microphone is also very good as well. It can pick up commands even through music at a good distance away.

The problem comes when the internet is lost, even for a short time.
While my echo dot automatically reconnects when the internet is restored, the plus will not.  I am forced to constantly reset it and reboot the modem until it finally reconnects.  Sometimes this process takes hours because I have to repeat the connection process over and over until it finally decides to connect.
Perhaps my echo plus is defective.  If so, I have no problem getting a replacement, but I need to be certain it is truly defective and not a quirk of the plus.

5 stars when it's connected and functioning.  1 star because it won't automatically reconnect like my echo dot does and it's a nightmare to manually reconnect.

As is usually the case, amazon tech support is non-existent.

UPDATE:  I was actually contacted by someone from Amazon Tech Support.  They sent me a replacement Echo Plus that remedied this connectivity problem when the internet is lost for a while.  However, this replacement Echo Plus will not recognize any of my lights, even the bulb that came with the device.  I've tried everything from rediscovery to the paper clip reset then doing a discovery.  The old Echo Plus discovers and operates the lights perfectly.

Interestingly, the new Echo Plus will operates the lights but only if the old Echo Plus is also plugged in (in a different room).  Pull the plug on the old Echo and the new Echo suddenly doesn't recognize any of the lights.  I'm at a loss as what to do now.  I've got to send one of these Echo's back soon or I'll be charged for it.

Tiresome.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This thing is WORTH it! If you think the echo dots have good sound quality, you can literally multiply that sound quality by three, and that is how good the plus sounds. It's about the size of three echo dots stacked on top of one another. And the bass rattles my floors. Buy this thing, and make your life so much better. Plus it has a hub in it, saving you tons of money down the road for all your other devices, such as lights and smart plugs.
Edit: No, seriously, I am blown away by the speaker on this thing. I cannot stress enough how amazing this little thing is, it puts out the same amount of awesome sound you can get from a set of really good computer speakers. The bass and everything is just so great!! It's rattling my walls, floors, and couch.

It sounds slightly better than the previous gen 2 without the hub, but not by much.  My Bose Revolve + still blows it out of the water along with my HomePod.  That being said, I'm comparing apples to oranges, but if you are expecting amazing sound, keep looking, it's not here.  Come on Amazon, I would gladly pay more for a quality smart speaker that had comparable sound to Bose/Apple.  And no, I don't want to have to mess with nor have the room to configure 2 Echos and a sub together.  Give me one speaker.

I'm not trying to have a dance party here but it's at a great level for really listening to and enjoying music. It's much louder than a slightly smaller sized Anker I had before. At some point I'll probably add another to the living room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This year I decided to get it for her and after reading the reviews I decided that I wanted one too, so I decided to get the Plus for myself. I am so happy that I did. She wanted to be able to control the lights in her room so I purchased a box of Sengled Smart light bulbs as well. The set up for both devices  and connecting with the bulbs was quick and easy. We have been playing with both the plus since this morning, asking it to play music, about the weather, the time etc.  I cannot wait to see what else this little device can do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The following all happened on the first day of owning this:

1) MOST of the time when I ask for music it only plays through the 1 echo, and NOT the stereo + sub. The only guaranteed way to get stereo + sub is through the Alexa app and not voice command.
2) I'll say ""Alexa stop"" and it'll stop playing music, then I'll say ""Alexa play"" and instead of restarting or playing new music it'll say ""Not currently playing music"" and not play anything.
3) Sometime after starting music it will play at at low volume for 20+ seconds as if Alexa is listening.
4) After pausing music, when I restart it can sometime take 20+ seconds before playback starts.
5) Music has occasionally just stopped playing for no reason, despite having songs left in my queue.
6) Remote doesn't work while music is playing, only when it's not playing.

The quality of the sound is very good for the price, and once (if) they fix the bugs it'll be a terrific setup. But the voice command implementation for stereo + sub is poorly implemented and the bugs are extremely frustrating so for now my advice is to stay away.

Update: After 3 weeks issue 1 is still happening so dropped to 1 star. Amazon say they're looking into it but unless it's fixed this will stay at 1 star as it's extremely frustrating. Also added a sixth issue above regarding the remote with the stereo/sub pair for those considering buying it.

Update 2: After 2 months issues 1, 4, 5 and 6 still occur regularly.
Issue 1 can be mitigated by saying ""play on stereo sub pair"" or if it's in a group ""play on <group>"". Note that setting up a group with left and right echos added and the stereo sub pair as the preferred speaker seems to improve things but the issue still occurs.
Also found another issue, this time with the multi-room music functionality: If I play on the multi-room setup via the Alexa app and try to interact with Alexa by voice if will often say ""No music playing on this device"" and ignore the instruction.

Amazon's customer support have been great as usual trying to help and keeping me up to date with my bug reports, but as a software developer with over 20 years experience I have to call it - the team that developed this should be ashamed of themselves, it's poorly implemented and poorly tested. A prime example of rushing the software out and letting the paying public do the beta testing. Fully deserves its single star.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We also linked a smart powerstrip we got with no problems, connected her to our Xbox so she can turn in on and off, launch games and apps and pause and play videos, and our absolute favorite thing is to ask her for the room temperature since we're both always arguing about whether it's actually cold in our bedroom or not lol.

I love the echo plus the sound quality is amazing the base is amazing I use it for everything I use it as my morning alarm, it’s my clock, it’s my weatherman, I use it for reminders all the time (I was constantly leaving sodas in my freezer and they were exploding and now I just asked Alexa to remind me to get my soda out in 10 minutes and it’s a quick simple request and it works every time and it has saved me money in my soda purchases) :)
I use it as a timer for exercises and stretches I get my news from it I use it when I’m away to turn on my lights I use it to play music for my dog when I’m gone (saves my tv as no more keeping the tv on for her) it’s just I don’t know what I would do without it at this point I use it not just every day but 100 times a day and it’s super easy to coordinate through the app on your phone with my second Echo Dot like to do things such as play music in both rooms at same time or have different reminders and timers kept separately.
I’ve kept the same wake word but they know which one I’m talking to! so they don’t both go off at same time. it’s just great I love the future","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It takes a little while to get everything to sync. I also purchased 4 Meross smart plugs. They work very well with both the Eco Dot and the Eco Plus. I plan on ordering 4 more. One drawback and I hope Amazon will fix this. It doesn't communicate with my Roku.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Plus-Bundle-Philips/product-reviews/B07H1QBW2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_42?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=42&reviewerType=all_reviews"
