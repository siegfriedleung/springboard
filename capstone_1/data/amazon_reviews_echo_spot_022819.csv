It's simply too small. The clock readout is hard to read- and the display options don't make it better. Whichever ""graphic artist"" thought making ""10:30"" with ""10"" and the ""30"" BELOW it vertically should be fired and then banned from design. Half the digital clock options are formatted this way and its hard to read. There isn't one single option that maximizes the screen size to make the time more legible. And unless you're sitting on your bed staring at your nightstand- anything else about the digital display is useless because of size.  I wanted to try an Alexa device and also wanted a different alarm clock from my old ugly screeching one. As it stands my old clock is on one nightstand so I can you know, tell the time- and the Spot is on the other. I could've just ordered a full size Echo with better sound for $30 less and still wake up to music, sets alarms etc.  If you want a visual device get the full sized screen model and wait for a sale. Don't waste your money on this model.

Bell","Best Bedside Clock I've Ever Owned!","May 21, 2018","We love our Spots!! The best bedside clock I've ever owned. Customize the clock face, tell Alexa to wake you up to your favorite radio station, music  or many other options. Listen to a huge selection of free, soothing ambient sounds to go to sleep, or your favorite audible book or podcast. Alexa will even read your digital book collection to you. Know the day, or week's weather at a glance. Don't worry about people 'spying' on you, you can turn off the mic and camera with the tap of a button, or schedule them to be turned off automatically during certain times. The only drawbacks are that this is still new technology, under development, and I'm anxiously waiting for upgrades and new features. Otherwise, I love my echo devices and the Spot is 'spot on'!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_48?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=48&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My vision is fine in case you were wondering. When somebody activates my Ring doorbell and I ask Alexa who’s at the door I have to hold the screen 6” from my face to see who it is. Maybe if it had a rechargeable battery and I could take it with me around the house it would be ok I guess. In my opinion I would save your money and buy the version without a screen because the screen is basically useless. I’m in return window and I’m seriously considering a swap out but geez what a pain that is...
  After I posted this review I almost immediately received a phone call from Amazon. They actually called me to make sure everything was ok and just basic troubleshooting on my device which isn’t broken by the way. But the fact that they care to call and listen to any suggestions you may have is really quite impressive if you ask me.

I pre-ordered the Spot and received it the first week it was available.  After a months use now, I have to give it a big thumbs up!  I set it up on a nightstand in my bedroom and it replace my original Echo that I'd had there since it first came out.  I got a white one and that was a good decision for our decor but I got some immediate negative feedback from my technophobe wife.  She liked the way it looked but it did not put out the quality music we had received from the original Echo.  I knew this would be the case but had plans to add small stereo bluetooth speakers (one on each nightstand) to improve the sound beyond even that of the original Echo.  My wife was resistant to having a speaker on her nightstand but now seems to have accepted them as the trade-off for the much improved music we get from the Spot.  I am expecting Amazon to add to the visual capabilities over the year ahead, although it comes already with a variety of interesting and useful image options.  Next project is to add some smart features around the house!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is PRECISELY what I was looking for. It's easy to use, I can connect my Spotify account to it, I can tell Alexa what sound to wake me up to, AND I can listen to rain audio on a loop while I sleep at night, with the display still completely off so it doesn't keep me up. I haven't customized mine with a personal photo yet but I plan to soon. I love that I can see the weather on it when I first wake up. I don't like having to use my phone as soon as I wake up. So the fact that I don't have to rely on my phone for an alarm clock anymore, and I don't have to use it to check the weather before getting ready for the day, is a huge plus for me. I like that I can set important reminders so I can have a fresh reminder in the morning (again, without having to rely on my phone). It doesn't take up much space at all, the display is crisp and clear, and I love that you can watch Amazon Prime on it, even if it is a small screen. I will definitely be recommending this to friends and family who are looking for something similar to what I was looking for. The camera is a little creepy. You are able to turn the camera off but... come on. We all know why that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Other than that though, I love this thing.

While it's a lot of money for an alarm clock, it does so much more.  I do like that I can simply tell Alexa to set an alarm and it works... gone are the days of pressing ""+"" and ""-"" buttons to set the damned alarm.  It is somewhat difficult to snooze, and turn off the alarm, although you can use Alexa to do that too.  I'm not sure who said it makes a bad alarm clock, but IMO, they are wrong.  Mine wakes me up to a ""Come on City!"" chant - what a world we live in when your alarm clock can make you feel like you're at a stadium 3,000 miles away!

Some other ""weird"" things - It responds to room light and such, which is great, but it also seems to ""know"" when I am standing in front of it.  When you walk away, the screen pretty consistently is on the clock part.  Once you get close to it, it starts displaying things like ""You can try this or 'say Tell me the weather'""  Okay, fine, I'm glad it makes suggestions, and you are able to turn that off, but it s a bit creepy that the damned camera is ""seeing"" when you're near the unit.

I didn't care much for how it connected via Bluetooth to my iPhone.  The display of the Spot simply shows it's connected to a Bluetooth device.  I'd much rather it show what music is playing or something useful.

All-in-all, having gotten it on sale for $99 (probably closer to what it's worth to me), I am happy.  For $130 (original price), I probably wouldn't have pulled the trigger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just make sure you connect to your in-home wifi and then download the Alexa app.  I went with Alexa over Google, primarily because we own a Ring Video Doorbell and Alexa interfaces with the device.  Unfortunately, while we can see the front door video, we can't communicate through the Spot - still requiring us to respond on our phone or tablet.  That was a disappointment.

Alexa has lots of ""skills"" ... many of which are tough to use, because if you don't get the question/request phrased properly, it won't know how to answer.  Still, the automation aspect is convenient.  I can get my music from Spotify easily.  Just a simple voice command.  And the sound is surprisingly good for such a little device.  I can also send lists to my HP Printer with a simple command.  I've customized my NewsFlash ... to get news, weather, etc.

We've even made a few video calls with Alexa.  My wife, who thought I was crazy getting the device, now uses it more than I do!  Go figure!  It's not perfect.  But it is fun!  And we even get some productivity out of it.

Alexa works and understamds me well, but what I think is the true gold mine, are all the skills that you can teach her. It’s a whole new world out there.

I use her for my lights (via outlets) and as a music speaker which is great. I like that she can give me the run down as I’m getting ready. Basically, I don’t regret a penny.

That being said, I wish she was a bit smarter. There are things I wish she could do better and the app drains my phone battery, but I think I’m being a bit critical for those things. When I was on a trip and I needed my phone to last, I just removed the app. When she doesn’t understand something, I rephrase it and she tends to understand. But that’s the nature of technology, it’s constantly changing and upgrading so I have hopes for the upgrades Alexa will have in the future and the skills she will gain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_79?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=79&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My biggest issue is the lack of apps and such. Sure the skills are great, but for something that has a screen you would hope it would also have menus and such. Because sometimes you don't want to use your voice to figure out what's on prime videos, just wanna click the app and scroll.

However! It does what I need it to, control my lights, and be a desk clock. Might actually buy one for myself just to upgrade my echo dot to a spot.

Also as a side note, they should make a gesture that initiates alexa without calling her name.

We use it for mostly the same things as the Dots - timers, curating our grocery list, listening to music, and playing games with our 3 year old. We got the Spot so we could also video chat with our family from out-of-state. It works great and my parents have told us the picture is great, my only complaint is that since this has to be connected to a power source, we can't move it around as we talk or we drop the call. I wish this had a chargeable battery so we could move from the dinner table to the living room and continue the call. The screen & camera are fairly small, but work pretty well on the receiving end. Also, it's built to work when you're sitting or standing so difficult to show my infant daughter on screen because she's usually lying down.

The sound quality of the speaker is strikingly better than the dot, and the traditional clock display is just beautiful!  It automatically dims based on room light situations.  We use it to ask Alexa for weather updates, traffic conditions, to wake up and to view our Ring security cameras.  The video size is a bit too small to anything in detail, but it is nice to have it there if ever we are alerted in the middle of the night by Ring app.  These early versions of Alexa are just a glimpse of what these devices will be able to do in the near future and its exciting to see where we are headed technologically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have (4) Kindle readers, including the Fire tablet and a Fire TV, but they pale in comparison to the Echo.  I originally became interested when I saw it on sale and started to investigate it's function.  I decided that it would replace my bedside clock radio and make it easier to change wake up alarm settings and wake up to interesting music selections (night mode was a plus).  Now I find I can add ""smart home"" devices and have ordered a wi-fi  controlled outlet for my living room lamp (I presently use an analog device).  I use the Echo to time my workout session on the ""teeter hangups"" (I used the timer on my Kindle Fire before; saves opening another device).  I've added my calendar, so I can check pending events when I wake up.  And I am sure to find other uses as I learn more about the ""Echo"" line.

I would like to warn potential buyers about some fellow reviewers.  When I first started to investigate the Echo Spot, I read reviews and questions; as I usually do.  I  found around 142 answers on the subject of the "" annoying 'Things to Try' home card; and how  you cannot delete the same in the rotation.  About 10 answers explained how to stop the rotation and the rest complained; many expressing how they would not buy this product until Amazon met their demands of absolute perfection (these I call lemmings; you know the little rodents who follow the leader over the cliff without really knowing where they are going).  I feel sorry for the lemmings, because they are missing out on a great product (not as perfect as they are, but good).  I would advise to think for yourself; read reviews with an open mind and realize that not everyone is capable of writing a competent review (i.e. ""I haven't opened the package yet, but it looks like it will work okay"")

For what it's worth, I  like this product because it's interesting, fun to use and makes a GREAT alarm clock (all I ask). Thank you Amazon ""development team"" for the Echo line for an affordable, fun and useful product.

I'll make this brief as the reviews below already showcase the great tricks that the Spot & Alexa in general can do.
All my Amazon products are great but the Spot is definately the most sexy of them all.
Half the fun is finding out all the hidden, neat tricks it can do and the platform is getting smarter every day.
Living in Scandinavia (Norway to be precise) Amazon products aren't really officially available although some mail order companies are importing them.
There used to be a problem a while back where you couldn't set the real location to get the correct time/weather/etc, but now that restriction has been lifted and it works just fine on my Spot, Show, etc.
And yes, the video ""drop-in"" function works just fine between Alexa devices and mobile phones here in Norway in case you're wondering.
Here's just a few of Alexa's uses that I find invaluable (in no particular order) . . . .
""Show me the front door/back door/garden"" will bring up a live feed from my Arlo wireless cameras onscreen.
""Put milk and tea on my shopping list"" will add these items to the shopping list on my Alexa phone app immediately.
""Play David Bowie from Spotify"" will indeed work on all my devices if you have a Spotify Premium account.
""What is my flash briefing"" delivers a custom news feed from BBC, Sky, CNN, latest Bitcoin prices, etc.
""What's the weather like"" will announce the day's weather report and display the forecast for the next few days onscreen.
""Turn the lights on/off/red/blue/50% etc"", controls my Philips Hue lighting in the entire house.
""Play BBC Radio One"" streams the station to whatever room I ask.
""Turn the temperature up 2 degrees"" will instruct my Hive system to do just that.

Here's some useful tips in general for your Alexa devices.

For better sound quality when playing music, you can of course use the line out jack but if you have a home cinema amplifier with Bluetooth it's really elegant to simply use that method instead of having cables all over the place.

By creating a WiFi hotspot on your mobile phone, you can even have an Echo Dot in your car for on the move info and voice controlled music.

If you have Samsung SmartThings, Arlo cameras or a Sonos audio installation, Alexa is the perfect companion.

The Spot - a solid, well designed and for me an essential addition to my ever expanding Alexa family.
I honestly can't imagine life without them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I purchased 2, 1 for the kitchen, and one for my nightstand. I was hoping it would be better for viewing cameras, but the screen is on the smaller side. Sound is good and fills the room nicely. They don't have the booming bass that the full-sized Echo has, but still very good for listening to music and news. I would have pulled a star off my rating because of the lack of functionality with Blink and Ring cameras, but that seemed excessive. I was hoping to be able to say, ""Alexa, show my the front door."" and see what's going on outside. She will show it to you, but you will end up sticking your face right up to the screen to be able to see it. If this is your intention, go ahead and purchase the Echo Show.  Also, note that the Original (1st Gen) Ring doorbell is not compatiable with this feature.

My basic issue with this item is that it seems to have voice recognition issues that the other units to not have. There are times when I have to physically pick it up and speak into the mic holes form inches away. The placement of the mics might be the issue since they are set to the back of the top. I replaced it an have the same issues. The only other thing I can think that might cause this is that they for some reason tested this with people sitting and standing around it but not with someone laying in bed. Not sure if your voice changes that much when prone or if it has an issue understanding commands which are not pointed right at it. The ring seems to be searching in random directions for our speech just before it craps out and wants you to try again. I am going to try to cobble a shroud across the back to see if that will direct sound into it better.

Happy now!!","October 18, 2018","Update:  I received the replacement, and was able to connect to bluetooth,  It no longer cuts in and out.  Also, the audio works much better.  When using the drop-in feature on the old one, it was hard to hear the person on the Echo Spot.  The replacement is much better!  I'm glad the first one we had was just defective, as I really wanted this to work.  My only gripe now is that the halo light is only visible if you are in front of the Spot.  We have it on a Kitchen island, so if you are behind it and say ""Alexa"" you can't see if she heard you.  I hope to see an improved version that places a light on the back as well, or on the top.

Old: I have several Echo Dots that work great!  I expected this Spot to at least work as well, if not better.  Turns out, it has issues.
1.  Can't connect to Bluetooth devices via the normal method from my phone's app.  Figured out though that I was able to do it from the settings menu on the actual device, since it has a touch-screen, unlike the Dots.
2.  The Bluetooth audio is terrible.  Constantly cuts in and out.  I know it's not my Yamaha Receiver, because my other Dots can connect to it and stream just fine.  Tried upgrading it's firmware, rebooting, and performing a factory reset, with no luck.
3.  Mainly purchased it for the Ring doorbell app.  It works, but doesn't let you talk to the doorbell.  Maybe not Amazon's fault, but still unfortunate that I can see and hear guests, but not communicate with them.  Kinda wish Echo ran Android.

Life will never be the same....","October 29, 2018","I've had this little thing for less than 6 months and I can honestly say I cannot imagine how I existed for 47 years before this. By far and away the best bedside alarm clock every conceived and built by man kind. Aside from the hundreds of things it can do, these following use cases have proven to be indispensable for me daily:

1. without opening my eyes or putting on my glasses to see the time I can simply ask ""Alexa, what time is it?"" This alone - worth $120 for a myopic person like me
2. Without opening my eyes or moving - ""Alexa let me sleep for 20 more minutes"".
4. As I'm getting dressed - ""Alexa read me my scheduled for the day"" and ""Alexa, give me a flash briefing"" and ""Alexa what is the weather going to be like in [name of city I am traveling to] today?""
5. ""Alexa turn off all the lights""
6. ""Alexa lock the front door""
7. ""Alexa is the Garage door closed?""
8. I have one in my office - The duplex speaker phone makes calls through my ATT iPhone and the voice quality is as good as my Polycom. - again this use case alone is worth more than $120.

It was so popular with my kids that they each received one for their birthday and in both cases (6 year old boy and 10 year old girl) it eclipsed all other gifts.
Popular use cases for the kids:
""Alexa wake me at 7 am to Bruno Mars""
""Alexa what is the name of this song?""
""Alexa drop in on [the other siblings] bedroom""
""Alexa what is the schedule for this weekend?""
""Alexa set the timer for 30 minutes"" - so we all know how long they are playing Fortnite.

Several others have done a great job reviewing it in detail but there are just a couple things I wish it could do.

1) More face customization. I’d love for the numbers to be red or green (like standard alarm clocks) at night and the screen to be solid black. I wear glasses so it’s hard for me to read. The white font is so hard to see!!! Being able to adjust the font size ( with  slide like dimming feature) would be great too.

2) more sound options. Maybe during DND mode she doesn’t need to respond to you with “OK”, for example. I’d LOVE to be able to set specific volume levels for different things. Like when my kids drop in I’d like the volume a little louder than the when I play music and ask her questions. This wish would apply for all echo devices.

Overall, I just wish there were more customization features. I feel like it would be relatively simple to add through a firmware update.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Another major issue is that if you link to a Bluetooth device, you can’t have music go to other echo devices at the same time, and the Spot goes silent. Also, if you use multi-room listening mode so that music plays on all your echo devices, you can only play music. All other services will only work thru the unit you select as your main device.

I just uploaded an image of a new interface when you ask Alexa to dim the lights, bedroom off, kitehen on etc...it’s an image of a lamp with a slide toggle that you can touch to increase or decrease the brightness. WHY?! When I’m asking Alexa to dim the bedroom to 50% I don’t need to touch the screen. When I say “bedroom off” the lights go off but the Alexa is still bright screen with this hideous interface on the screen for 10 seconds until it goes away then it auto adjusts. THIS IS RIDICILOUS. I don’t want this device anymore. It’s so painful and  unbearable to use.

Dealbreaker is the THINGS TO TRY. Please remove this. I don’t want to see this. I own several echo items. I know what to try. At least give an option to toggle this on or off. Everytime I ask for something like “turn the lights off” it then starts the slides with things to try. I don’t want this. I know I can set to show things to try only once after a request but this seems so silly that I cannot turn it off completely.

We're very familiar with their functionality and what Alexa can do.  I'm flabbergasted why Amazon isn't listening to its customers, and instead forces this devices to show ""Things to Try with Alexa"" quotes. I'd rather have the clock and the calendar persistently showing, instead of tutorial lines.  Let's be honest - this item was designed to look like a bedside clock, looks like a bedside clock, and certainly functions like one too.

People have complained about the ""Things to Try"" disabling for years.  It would be nice if Amazon actually listened.

Secondly, I'm revising this review after spending over a week with the device.  I have found its timekeeping extremely poor.  I have turned off the Wi-Fi (as I'm not a big fan of a radio transmitter placed inches from my head while I sleep), and with the Wi-Fi off, the timekeeping of the clock is extremely poor.  Over the course of a week, it ran 10+ minutes faster.

Lastly, while the device offers a way to schedule a DO NOT DISTURB mode, this mode doesn't allow you to include Wi-Fi disabling.  I'm personally not a big fan of having a 2.4Ghz (same frequency as your microwave oven) radio transceiver inches from my head throughout the whole night.  There should be a way to disable Wi-Fi in the do-not-disturb mode, or otherwise create a schedule.

Needless to say, I feel like this device was rushed to market without adequate thorough R&D.  Mine is going back to Amazon today.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But then I saw other reviews saying they could. So I took the leap and bought this. Great decision!  This clock is small but heavier and sturdier than most small clocks. You can choose from a variety of faces for it, which is fun. I opted to have night mode come on automatically in low light (alternative is to set it for certain times). This clock is the only one I’ve had where the night mode is truly unobtrusive—the clock hands just glow softly rather than there being any back light. I googled how to turn off the rolling banner and it took a few tries on my phone app and on the clock settings but it’s off. So no complaints!  We’re just starting to figure out how to use Alexa. Bought a smart plug and this morning I rolled over in bed and told Alexa to turn on the tea kettle in the kitchen which we’d set up the night before. Perfection!  Now we just need her to fix the tea and bring it to us in bed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Now I can drop in from my phone app, and see what's going on in our family room. We ordered the adjustable stand to aim it accurately and while annoyed a bit at the price, have to say totally worth it. Great view and clear pic!

One will most definitely be sacrificing one's privacy by using this product and all others like it.

All necessary disclaimers aside, I'm really enjoying this little thing.  The display was perfect for a bedside clock right out of the box; I didn't find it necessary to adjust the brightness at all.  In absence of light, it automatically dims so as to never be obtrusive.

Alexa, while maybe the smartest voice assistant available, is still pretty dumb; it's probable that she'll do what you want her to, as long as you can find the magic combination of commands, but she's not exactly savvy to normal speech.

I love telling my clock to wake me up at a certain time without worrying about using buttons or wondering if I remembered to turn the alarm on, and I also love that I can tell it to play music for awhile and turn off automatically.  The weather feature is also nice, and the display automatically returns to the clock face after using it for other functions.  It may also surprise you how many times you end up just asking Alexa what time it is instead of looking at the clock.  Also, the spot is connected to my Ring doorbell and my Nest thermostat, so I can ask it to turn up the heat or AC or show me the front door whenever I want.

I feel like it's been money well spent so far; no buyer's remorse for me at this price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a couple of other Echo devices, so I thought this would go well with the fleet. I was wrong. I wanted two things out of the spot (as opposed to getting another Dot) - show the weather and show a perpetual slideshow from my Prime Photos. Neither works. It is impossible to enable weather, news, or any other text without also enabling a bunch of ""Try this now"" stuff. It is so annoying that I gave up on displaying anything other than the clock. I configured the slideshow from a Prime Photos album, but it just gets stuck on one photo forever. I tried removing that photo from the album. It displayed two other photos, then got stuck forever on the third. I've tried resetting the device multiple times but nothing helped.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is attractive with better sound than the Dot (of which I am not a fan), and the screen is quite good. The down side probably is the PC app,. On the Amazon website, it said that there were several clock faces to choose from, that are chosen from a Device option on the PC app. But alas, no device option was found.. You can create a new ""reminder"" on the PC app, but not create a new alarm (must do verbally on the Spot).
..
In general, the PC app needs to catch up with the Alexa devices. Because of the limited vocabulary and interaction of Alexa, I find it much easier to do setups using the PC app than doing it verbally. And with the app, I can control all my devices in one location (my desk). But the app needs major work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The people I talked to were not really helpful. The first one didn't seem to understand my problem and transferred me to another department that only works with fire sticks and the like.

While the Spot is small, it would be nice if the speaker was a little bit better. The microphone does not always hear commands, Amazon might consider moving the microphone to the front panel instead of having it on top.

I use my Spot as an alarm clock however Alexa will not let me set an alarm for Monday-Friday, I have to set an alarm every night for the next morning.

Overall the Spot is a solid device and I am happy with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_160?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=160&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes, I know actual alarm clocks are much much cheaper but I'm already consumed by the Alexa world so this was an obvious choice.
  The screen clarity is great. I don't watch anything on it. The downside to a round screen but the many choices in clock faces has allowed me to personalize my area. I do wish the camera was not there but nothing a black sticky dot couldn't take care of. I do have the option though if I'm sick or bed restricted, my family can contact me bedside. But until that day comes, the sticker stays and it's not noticable.
  Coming from someone who has sleep issues, the ability to customize the alarm tones has helped. If I ever get used to one sound and run the risk of sleeping through my alarm, I simply change the tone or add music to get me awake.
  The sound quality is good, especially from such a small device. I was expecting it to be similar to the Echo Dot but it's much better. The option to add an external speaker if needed it a great thing. I haven't needed it but I like options.
  The only down side to this whole thing is not the device itself. It's the cost. I went for the Echo Spot because I have an Echo Show in the Kitchen and I love it. The cost however was way too much to buy as a bedside alarm clock. So I bought the Echo Spot. Not two days later, the Echo Show dropped in price for a bit. Had I waited two more days, I would have bought another Echo Show. Oh well. That's Amazon for ya.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Huge savings and a huge delight.
Ignore the whiney 1 star reviews. Every alexa device I own gives me things to try pointers, and as a person who appreciates technology and new advances in my alexa products, I like knowing about them and appreciate the tips. There is nothing bothersome about it and it runs as a clock as it should. I even have it set as to where my amazon photos will play in the background behind the clock for the clock face. Talk about being custom!
Aside from functioning as a clock the spot works just the same as it would the alexa show, only on a smaller device and screen.
Personally I though I wasn't going to like having a smaller screen, but I don't notice the difference when making video calls. I actually like the smaller screen for this.

The speaker is crisp and clear and it can get loud if you set it to max. Like really loud. I cannot fathom why anyone would complain about the speaker. It's great, and defintley made my echo dot seem puny in comparison.

The device itself is way heavier than I imagined it would be. Quality was important to the developers, and it shows. This is not a cheap plastic device. It's heavy, has weight and won't slide off of your end table anytime soon.
I love how it paired up with my ring camera and monitor. I can check on them as needed with no hiccups or connection issues

Overall:
 Im glad I decided to shop for one of these. Initially I was going to grab another amazon show, but didn't need such a large device on my end table. The spot worked out perfectly with features I appreciate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The more I use it, the more I find it can do.  The speaker sound is great for such a small device (the size of a softball) and the screen, while small, is crisp.  Unlike some Alexa-compatable devices, like Vobot, the Spot has full integration with Ring to video show the front door, Nest, Remotesy (to verbally control most of your remotes) and Pandora (with lyrics displayed on the screen).  As a father of two teens, I need the lyrics (or the kids make fun of me for loudly singing fake ones)!
The only thing that keeps Spot from 5-stars is the dependence on a cord.  Amazon could remedy this with a portable docking station(s).  Also, albeit minor, it would be nice to verbally or through the app have Alexa hold the screen to time instead of a cycle of headlines, weather and time.  I know I can program time only but occasionally I want something like, “Alexa, scroll headlines for ten minutes” without interrupting my music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_64?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=64&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I worried about privacy that way and seems Amazon thought of that as well in the commands you can give Alexa. Sound quality is better than I expected out of the unit - figured it would be much like the Dot but actually sounds a lot stronger than that. Overall, pleased I bought it!
That said, I think it still has a little ways to go to becoming an outstanding product.

Initial setup was easy with the Drop Cam (called Nest Cam now) and the video comes in clear with a nice zoom in feature. However, I failed to read the reviews of the Nest Cam Alexa Skill before purchasing as a number of people call out that it times out after 30 minutes. I discovered this and thought it was a bug or connection issue, but alas it is by design. Since there are two companies involved, I'm not sure who is imposing the 30 minute limitation, but for my purposes it renders the product useless. If you're only going to use it to check cams occasionally, then this would be a great product. However, if the intent is to leave it on for hours as a baby monitor it won't work. This might get fixed by Amazon or Nest/Google, but I didn't want to wait around hoping so I returned it and reverted back to using a phone or tablet as a bedside monitor. Also, since Amazon and Google have been squabbling lately with interoperability, I wouldn't hold my breath on this getting fixed. P.S. I considered replacing the Nest Cam with the new Amazon Cloud Cam, but that product doesn't seem to be fully baked yet.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_112?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=112&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Many complaints were about certain features that could be changed in settings.  I love this as a bedside clock.  I sleep alone so there are no issues with waking your partner when giving Alexa verbal instructions.  You can turn off the camera if you wish.

There are lots of settings but don't expect to plug it in and have it work exactly the way you want to right out of the box.  I wanted to use Spotify instead of Amazon Music.  You need a premium subscription which I have.  When I connected my account, it still used Amazon Music.  I had to change the default in the settings.

I used to use my phone as a clock but the display would come on at night for no reason.  I used to use my phone to check the weather before I got up.  Now I just ask Alexa.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_78?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=78&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I immediately disabled the camera via the app and put a tiny black sticker over it, and turned off the auto-brightness feature so that it didn't dim the screen. So far, no negative implications as a result. I don't want a camera in my bedroom, and I think a lot of people might feel the same way.

I have a bunch of Alexa-enabled devices, so the features that all of them share were no surprise, but the screen is really a cool addition! I set up the device, uploaded an image from my iPhone X to use as home screen and alarm background, and customized my alarm sounds within minutes. Like the Dot it is replacing, this allows me to easily control lights, fans, and other automation devices, but if you have a Ring doorbell, get ready to get excited! ""Alexa, show me the front door!"" It displays in seconds, which is faster than it shows up on the Ring app on my phone! Awesome.

This is a great addition to the family of devices, and works exactly how I would want it to work as an alarm clock. I love how it is so easy to customize, and that it's easy to dim completely at bedtime. When you listen to Amazon music, it displays in the same way it does when you stream on Amazon Fire TV, which is a nice touch.  The device itself is clean and elegant-looking, not cluttered with a bunch of buttons or knobs. It's the first of the product line to be truly stylish, and looks so cool it could easily be mistaken for a product made by a certain fruit-named company :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_56?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=56&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1. Needs the ability to send/receive sms via iPhone.

4. Needs to have a way to have the volume return to what it was set to after an alarm. I keep the volume at a “7”, but when the alarm goes off it jumps to a 10. Super annoying!!

A bug or two...","December 21, 2017","Up until this point I've been using an echo for my alarm but I got the spot to hopefully be both my wife and my alarm. The screen is a very nice addition to the alexa function

The one bug I've found is I tried to set different alarm sounds for each alarm within the Android app, but it still just used what was selected in the spot.

I really don't care about the camera privacy, they can look at my bare bunghole all they like. The wife however claims she'll be covering it whenever it's sexy time.

It's a bit pricey, but if that doesn't bother you I think it's a real nice bedside device. The sound quality is also much better than the for.

The 7inch show is also on sale for 20 bucks more, kind of tempting but totally different use, as that's a much bigger device","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_87?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=87&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The lack of access to YouTube is tempered slightly by the ability to view my Ring Video Doorbell feed via a simple voice command.  (For this feature alone, I'll eventually get 1 or 2 more Spots and another Ring Spotlight Camera, for the back entry.)

Very disappointed the light ring notifications don't function, hoping it's a software issue that will be addressed soon.

...and the ridiculous feud between Google and Amazon is stupid, frustrating for the consumer, and just plain bad business... (Amazon you claim to ""sell everything under the Sun"" ...but you won't sell the Google mini or max voice assistants... so Google won't let you use YouTube...  We -want- to access to our YouTube content...  So, just SELL the damn mini & max!!!)

Lastly, kill the overwhelmingly annoying ""things to try"" feature/tip/card...  (At the very least,  give us the option to shut it off...  Your users are literally -begging- you!!!)

If Google is presented with even a small subset of a song's lyrics, it returns several versions of the song(s) which have matching lyrics.

The devices also show a very limited command of ""search"" capability when you stray away from purchasing questions.

I selected no access to contacts on my phone settings.

I also selected disable access to contacts within contact list of Alexa app and I selected communications>contact list>manage contacts> block and my kids still can call anyone by accident or purposely.

Problems started almost immediately because one of my family members had a duplicate Amazon account with the same phone number, making it impossible to setup the Amazon Alexa app that is required to run these devices. Things only got worse when the duplicate account was removed by an Amazon employee. The app completely stopped working on his iPhone and required technical escalation with Amazon, after which I was given the 24-48 hour ""we don't know what's wrong"" blow-off. One down, two to go. I attempted to setup the second Echo on my step-mom's iPhone. The Spot was unable to access contacts, which was a major, major problem. The iPhone and the Spot were both on the same wifi so there was no reason for it. Alexa didn't want anything to do with her iPhone and kept saying ""You'll need to setup your Amazon Alexa app before I can access your contacts"". At this point I was starting to see a trend and it was the iPhone app. Two down, one to go. Completely frustrated, we decided to try using an android phone. Everything worked fine. Contacts were seen and Alexa was working...until we tried to ask her simple questions like ""Alexa, what time is it?"" For the most part, she answered them, until my stepmom asked her the same questions. Alexa either ignored her or gave the wrong answers. My mom seemed upset and lost interest in her Christmas gift almost immediately. Third times a charm, right? Wrong. I attempted to setup my parents android phones with the app but their phones were so old that they couldn't run the app at all, nor did they understand why the Spot wouldn't connect to their wifi. In short, what was supposed to be a fun Christmas gift turned into a day long disaster for all involved. I'm returning all 3 Echo Spots to Amazon.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Really glad I did. Wife told me this is by far the best tech gift I ever gave her (which mostly says that all the others were rather.. meh, too geeky for her). She wanted a new nightstand clock and we already had an Echo in the kitchen/living room area.. So having Alexa with music etc. was a nice bonus. The built-in screen is great for this form factor, speaker and microphones are OK too, considering.. Yes, it's Alexa in the cutest and most useful package so far. I wished it had more clock faces and options available, but that's not so important.

Took a star off because Amazon did not provide an Echo Spot model *without* the built-in camera. Come on, guys, many people dislike the idea of having a camera in their bedroom, so like many others I too had to put some discreet black tape over the camera (I know the camera can be disabled in settings but let's be realistic about ""software"" settings..). Another minor issue is that I could not find a scheduling function to adjust the brightness to minimum only during the night, while turning it back up during the day -- come on, how hard is that? It does have the rather useless ""night mode"" that can be indeed scheduled but that mostly alters the color hues and it does not provide *full control* over the brightness level -- which should be really at the very minimum in a dark room at night. So right now we have to keep the brightness very low all the time which makes the screen almost unusable during the day.. Which is not big deal as the device does not get much use during the day. Yes I am aware that the auto-brightness functionality might have been affected by the piece of tape I put over the camera -- which again, is Amazon's biggest fault in this device -- not providing a model option without the camera hardware.. or at least provided better brightness control (scheduling) for those of us who use a camera cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_376?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=376&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is the equal or exceeds my previous internet radios for the same or less money. What it is not is an alarm clock. You should not depend on a device that requires constant external power and continual internet access to wake you up. Either use a cell phone, battery-powered clock, clock radio with battery backup, or heck a wind-up clock if you really need to get up at a particular time. The unit is attractive and takes up little room. Recently Amazon announced that Spotify and SiriusXM would now be able to be used across multiple Echo devices in a multi-room group setup. Don't know about Spotify but if you add a Spot to your Echo group SiriusXM does not play across the group though you can listen to the service on a Spot only. Hopefully, Amazon will fix this bug in the Spot software. Amazon music works across all Echo devices in a multi-room enviroment even when a Spot is part of the group.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I’m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces.

Great design. Good sound. Nice screen. Even sleep sounds !
Alexa smarts !
I disabled the camera... don't care for that option !

Suggestions for Gen2: battery backup, and usb charge port.

Pros
1. Speaker is loud but quiet enough not to disturb others.
2. Fits just about anywhere and is very sleek.
3. The mic has a good range, of course don't expect it to hear you from another room.
4. Alarms and remainders are perfect for those who only need them at home and not on the go.
5. Routines is one of my favorite features, still very limited but I am sure with updates more customization will be allowed.
6. Amazon orders are tracked and you get notified when they ship and delivered.
7. Major music services are supported.

Cons
1. No Youtube support but you have Google to blame so you can't blame the Spot.
2. Mic is a little sensitive, my tv has activated Alexa without anyone saying ""Alexa"".
3. Very limited choice in themes for the clock.
4. Limited choice in ""wake"" words.

I was going to buy a 2nd Dot to replace my clock radio, when I saw this and realized it would work great for what I needed. The clock face can be customized and I have an alarm set for every weekday, so I never have to change it for weekends. I can also play music or ""sleep sounds"" to go to sleep by and set a sleep timer for how long to play. It wakes me to an alarm or a local radio station on Tune-in.

I really have never been a fan of the Echo line of products...they're beautifully made and functional from what I hear, but they've just never been all that helpful to me seeing as my main use for smart stuff is asking questions and scheduling. Google always just seemed better at day to day, non house related things. Still is. I had a Dot a few months back and literally just gave it away because it was useless and all the skills were too much work. I'm lazy. Which is why I need an alarm clock.

SO, when I saw the Spot I was like ""oh I need that, that's going to look so good on my nightstand.""

My old costco alarm clock was falling apart so I decided to invest the money. I figured I'd get a reasonable speaker and a cute custom clock and it was on sale so whatever I picked it up.

As an ALARM CLOCK its great.
-looks great
-great for playing music to wake you up or help you sleep
-tells me the weather so I can dress accordingly
-great for timers when I'm doing face masks, treatments and things
-great for shopping lists and reminders when I think of them while wandering around the house
-added perk of being able to track my amazon shipments

It can't answer any hard questions and it will never be all that helpful outside of the bedroom for ME PERSONALLY. I can't speak on integration with other products and I covered the camera because I have nobody to video chat with. But its a great little clock and I'll probably end up giving one as a gift to my parents in the future.  I'd also argue its the nicest looking Echo device. My only complaint is that it can't play Youtube videos independently anymore so I have to use bluetooth, but that's nobody's fault. Hopefully it can in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I would have returned the Echo’s I bought and got a few of these instead.  The camera isn’t great but definitely works well, there’s just other camera options out there at the same price point with clearer images, however I’m sure most people aren’t buying this for the camera option, that’s just a bonus.  You still get all the previous amazon echo features, and the other added bonus of a small screen now.

I have found it to be useful for some things such as setting reminders, kitchen timer, weather reports and more.  It is more than the Echo Dot because the screen gives you more information or makes working with it easier.  An example would be when you ask for weather the audio give you some information for the screen gives additional information like the weather for the next few days.

But the Spot doesn't seem to hear me as well as the other devices. I got it to replace the Tap I had been using as an alarm clock. It makes a decent alarm clock. I do have a couple of issues with the spot. The first is and most annoying problem I have run into is waking Alexa up, I have the wake word set to Echo and it frequently fails to recognize the wake word, Once I find a spot for the displaced Tap, I will change the wake word back to Alexa and hope that fixes the first issue. The second most annoying issue I have run into is actually turning the alarm off. I frequently turn the snooze function on instead of the alarm off, then I end up yelling at 6am from the shower to turn the darn thing off. It's only funny the first time. My other issue is choice of clock faces, I have the largest digital clock face set but I can't read it without my glasses.

But an unreliable alarm clock.","January 1, 2018","This is a pretty cool device. The hardware seems really good. Screen quality is wonderful, auto dimming works great, audio playback and pickup is quite good for the small size and thumbs up for adding the 3.5mm output so that this device can be used with external speakers for multi-room streaming. Also love the photo slideshow.

However, you can't manually set the time, the alarms or anything else without being connected to wifi and generally using the voice interface. I'd love for most if not all features being duplicated as on-screen options so you don't have to talk to it and wake your partner up to set or modify an alarm. A larger clock option would be nice so you can read the time from more than 10 feet away.  Also, if your internet or power cuts out this device basically turns into a pumpkin. Which I found out when my internet dropped out last night and the clock got stuck 6 hours off. So I didnt wake up on time today. See photo. Would like to see some sort of small backup battery and offline capability in the next gen to make sure that alarms still go off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love it's size. I love the build. I love what it does. BUT I CANNOT STAND THE ""Things to Try"" TAB. Even turning off the screen rotations to minimize the existence of the ""feature"" is not a true fix to remove it. It still shows up once, after every time you give the echo a command.

It wouldn't be such an annoyance if the ""things"" they wanted you to try were helpful, as opposed to mere ways to buy more things from the Amazon ecosystem. Such as ""What is the most popular toy"", ""Add Bruce Springsteen to my favorite artists"" etc. It's so stupid, and obviously fixable on Amazon's end.

COULD YOU EVEN IMAGINE IF YOUR OTHER ECHOS DID THIS AUDIBLY?!?!?!

I'm not sure if it's a dealbreaker for me yet. I tolerate it on my kindle, because I don't look at my kindle every 5 minutes to check the time.

1) There is a ""card"" on the homescreen called ""Things To Try"" -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.

2) By default, the homescreen cards ""cycle"" automatically, which is incredibly annoying.

I purchased this for my nightstand as I wanted to get a new alarm clock, as my old one was long in the tooth.  I also needed an Alexa device in the bedroom to control my lights/ceiling fan for my home automation.

It looks great and works very well as an alarm clock.  I would never watch video or do stuff like that on it.  I would have been happy with a cheaper display/speakers for a lower price.  I needed a dot with a clock - this is beyond that.  Speakers are better than expected but I wouldn't use it for music.

It dims very well for night use.  The snooze is almost too easy (just touch the screen...don't even need to look at it).  Only flaw in the alarm clock process was when I had a night when my ISP was down due to the weather.  No internet connection = can't set the alarm.  I always keep a battery powered alarm just in case so it wasn't a big issue, but just something to think about.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- The font for the clock is small, and nearly unreadable unless you are very close. This would be fine if it was possible to increase the font size, but you can't. You are stuck with the default, small font. There is a ""magnifier"" accessibility option where you can manually ""zoom in"" by pinching and tapping your fingers on the screen, but this causes all of the menus to be too big. It seems that Amazon's developers just assumed that everyone would have their alarm clock on a night stand, inches from their face.
- You can't coordinate your Echo alarms and reminders across multiple devices. So, if I set a reminder from the bedroom, ONLY the echo in the bedroom will announce the reminder. If you happen to be in another part of the house, you'll never hear the reminder -- and the other Echo devices won't remind you because reminders and alarms are all on a per-device basis. Obviously, you might not always want every reminder to be announced on every device, but it should be at least possible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_332?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=332&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With the spot, when you roll over or get up you can see what time it is. I use the analog face as it is easier to see at night. Heading the flash briefing in the morning is nice.

My phone alarm is not all that reliable. I needed an alarm clock that would repeat on specific days, but I wanted the convenience of simplicity. This product delivered everything that I wanted and more. It sounded the alarm for work perfectly. What really impressed me was it's flexibility. I have made a routine for when I wake up to turn on the lights automatically, give me the weather, traffic, and news as I am getting ready. Some people are bothered by the camera on it, but I don't do anything shady. If the NSA wants to spy on me, god help them when they see me walking around in my birthday suit. The only thing I would suggest is for the option to add music to the list of options for the routine feature. Other than that, it is amazing and I don't see myself getting bored with it.

Cons: Amazon's battle with Google. **Biggest down side** You are not able to watch YouTube (which is owned by Google) .

A real war horse.  Of course never did husband and wife alarms.  Her alarm went off at 5am and I had to hit the ""snooze"" and then reset it for 7am.  Every morning for decades.  We never used the radio, ever.  Love the large red LEDs.  While getting ready in the morning I could duck my head in the room and see the time easily from across the room.  This was my biggest fear with this Echo Spot.

So far have not missed the old clock radio.  This Spot is the BEST.  We can set both alarms and at 5am my wife says, ""Alexa stop"" and it goes back off at 7am for me.  And we don't have to turn it off for the weekend because we set ""weekdays at 5"" and ""weekdays at 7"" alarms.

No rolling over to hit the snooze bar or the reset button.  Love it. Well worth the $$$.

And we don't use half of what it can do.  It can play music, has a touch screen and can do video phone calls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Smith","Good device, but Amazon's greed hampers its usability somewhat","February 27, 2018","The device itself is five full stars -- its voice recognition is top-notch, its sound quality is quite decent for such a small object, it makes an attractive clock for a tabletop, its commands are logical, and it is very versatile.  It is extremely easy to connect up and get onto a wireless network, and I have one running through my Sony 1200 Watt/Channel 7.2 AV receiver where it provides excellent quality reproduction, equaling the sound quality of a CD.

I would also give five stars to Amazon's Unlimited Prime Music service but for one little (well, not so little) problem, to wit:  While for Prime members who purchase this device it only costs a reasonable $3.95/mo., we bought two of them under a special discount deal from Amazon, one for our bedroom and once for our living room.  Unlimited music is quite extensive and I have been able to find many quite obscure items that suit my rather eclectic tastes (I tried to fool it by asking for Harry ""The Hipster"" Gibson's ""Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy's Ovaltine,"" a scat song from 1947, and it didn't skip a beat).  While the unlimited music works on both devices (and the same content can play on both Spots simultaneously), it can only play one song or album at a time.  Amazon will not sell us a second service for $3.95 for the other device, which we would purchase if we could.  We would have to go to the $14.95/mo. ""Family Package,"" which is too expensive to be worth it, so we have to live with the limitation (and Amazon will have to make do without our additional $3.95 a month, but Jeff Bezos probably has enough to eke out a meager existence without it).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wasn't looking for another echo because we have an echo (first generation) or echo dot (second generation) in each room.  I had been interested in the echo show, but the price seemed high for a replacement echo and it seemed bulky for the places I would use them.  When they echo show popped up, I could justify the price and size.  I decided I wanted to use it as an alarm clock in my bedroom and I have been happy so far.  It replaced an echo (first generation).  The microphones work fine even all the way across the room.  The auto dimming at night works well so no glaring clock on my nightstand at night.  I use the sleep sounds skill as a white noise generator and the speakers sound good.  I like that I can pull the video for outside Arlo cameras and the picture is very clear, yet small.  When I pull traffic and weather it shows me all of the options for traffic and the full weather forecast on the screen.  My only gripe is the repeating alarms need to be more customizable.  If I want to cancel an alarm for a repeating weekday alarm for one day, I need turn off the whole alarm.  I then need to remember to turn it back on.  There doesn't seem to be any indicator on the clock face that the alarm is off to remind you to turn it back on like a regular alarm clock.  Correction: it does show the alarm setting on the clock face, including the time it's set for, so I upgraded my rating to five stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use it as an alarm clock in my bedroom. It fulfills that role perfectly, especially since I can set custom music playlists to play as the alarm. Only true downside is it has a camera built into it, be nice to have an option that didn't include the camera, especially since this is marketed as a smart alarm clock. Only other thing I can say which is neutral is that you can't edit the alarm music from the app, and specifying the alarm music through voice commands can be a bit finicky.  She will sometimes understand what you said and list the correct playlist as the alarm other times not so much. In the end it means just deleting the incorrect alarms and repeating the commands a few times till she gets it right. I marked this as neutral as I think this will improve with time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_106?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=106&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wait until version 2?","February 5, 2018","I like this alarm clock.  I know it does more, but that's pretty much the main function of it for me.  Its convenient to be able to set and cancel alarms by speaking to Alexa rather than messing with buttons & dials.  The quality of the speaker is pretty good too for such a small thing.  Its also nice that the screen brightness is auto dimming and I like asking Alexa the day's forecast and such in the morning to prepare for the day.
There's a couple issues that I have with it that makes me want to wait for a revised version.  First and foremost is the lack of an internal battery back up.  That is obviously not an issue most days, but it already almost made me late one night when the power went off.  So, if you really need to be sure you'll be up on time for a flight or other important event, you need so set your phone's alarm clock or similar back up device.
The other small issue I have is that if this device is on your partner's side of the bed, its really hard to see at night!  I like the fact that the screen dims almost to the point of being off, but I wish the light of the time (digits) was a little bigger or brighter (I know the brightness is adjustable, but it's still hard to see even on higher settings).  I feel the need to have another device on my nightstand to see the time when I wake up at night.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_269?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=269&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s the most useful device I use, and I’m a harcore Apple enthusiast. Alexa is very responsive and so far I haven’t had to repeat myself when asking Alexa to perform the requested function.
The screen is bright and color is perfect. This is a great device. You won’t be disappointed. I do recommend connecting this device to a larger Bluetooth speaker or connecting it to a pair of speakers via the 3.5mm port. The built in speaker is decent, but not good for music and other audio-rich content. I gave this 5 stars due to its usefulness, ease of use, responsiveness, and the fact it’s always getting better via its “skills.” I do not see this being a novelty device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_73?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=73&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros: Looks good as an alarm clock.  Neat gimmick/conversation piece.  Works well with my Ring Doorbell 2 except I have to tell it to show the front door.
Cons: Sound is sub par.  I'd put it just barely above a dot.  Camera is terrible.  $30 webcams do better.  Video is soo small you have to pick it up to watch trailers/how-to's/etc.

Overall it's a neat toy.  Not sure it was worth the $130.

My family was visiting the day after I received my Echo, so I was showing it off. My aunty who is not technolically privy absolutely loved it and was able to navigate and control it like an old pro.

Big Brother is watching So to speak.  I was very annoyed to find two problems with this which is not worth being able to turn off lights remotely, etc.
1) When you speak to Alexa, whatever you say is recorded in the cloud. You must manually go in and delete the recording’s every so often.  Defeats the purpose of security and privacy.
2)  several times I have been woken up in the middle of the night  By stupid advertisement recommendations. It’s bad enough that our phones, email, and snail mail gets spam mail! Now, you can get it delivered right to your inner ear while you’re sleeping! If someone knows how to turn this off then great but no one pays over 100 bucks to be bombarded with advertisements on a mini screen. Alarm clock, music, and control “smart outlets” is all people need or at least all I need.  The rest of the crap is just for Amazon and advertisers.

So when the Spot got announced, I was ecstatic that the power of this would be sitting on my nightstand.

For people to call it a glorified alarm clock is not doing it justice.  The mics work great, it can hear me from 2/3rds my house (the dot is ""alexa"", the spot is ""echo"" so they don't both act on a command), the speaker is sounds surprisingly great, and yes it makes an amazing alarm clock, especially with the update that came out this week to sound the alarm with Spotify music.

For my 2 cents, this device is an absolute ""must have"" for anyone even remotely into smart home stuff.

I highly recommend the Spot stand to be able to adjust the angle as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is compact and I don't mind the way it sits without the stand. It never loses connectivity, I like the clock face. It also scrolls through different things to try saying to Alexa, weather and trending topics, updates on any Amazon shipments, and the like, if you happen to be looking at the face. As far as weather goes, IMO Alexa herseld needs to default to a much more accurate weather service. I needed to know if there was rain in the forecast in the next few hours so I could blanket my horse. Alexa said no rain in forecast and only was able to tell me when it was currently raining. It annoys me to have to turn on my computer to get an accurate hour by hour forecast while Alexa just sits there. Nice device. I like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Did a quick search and found out this is the main complaint for the Spot. EVERYBODY hates this feature. I want to throw that piece of sh!t to the wall now.... it's so freaking annoying.

Other reviewers have compared it to a Magic 8 ball, and that is completely accurate.  If I were using it as a bedside or desktop clock, it would be fine.  I use it in a deep window sill next to my front door so I can see and speak to who is outside on my Ring 2.  For that purpose, I wish it were about 30 percent bigger (like maybe the size of a large grapefruit or small cantaloupe).  I have seen reviewers saying this does not have audio interface capabilities with the Ring 2.  That is NOT true.  Mine works great.  I say, ""Alexa, show me the front door,"" and the video appears on the screen.  Then, in the lower right-hand corner of the circle screen, there is an icon for a microphone with a diagonal line thru it (the  universal sign for ""muted"").  You press that icon, and the diagonal line disappears, which turns on the Audio.  The automatic/default muting is a safety so that people cannot turn on the microphone and eavesdrop on your home just by pressing your Ring 2 doorbell.  The audio is 2-way, clear, and easy to hear.  When you complete the encounter, say ""Alexa, go home"" and it disconnects and returns to your home screen.  Since there appears to be a lot of misunderstanding as to this feature, I wanted to point it out and make sure everyone understands it does work and how to access it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However it got moved to a front bedroom due to 8 year old loving it.  I had added a Dot downstairs and 6 smart plugs.  I can now use it to ""Turn on the lights"" and get lights upstairs and downstairs on.  I can then turn on or off each plug has needed.  was adding a Ring Doorbell, and when upstairs in the master found that needed a way to see the camera.  I was using a very old ihome radio as a alarm, heck it was for a iPhone 3g.  Updated to the Spot and LOVE it.  Its a great clock, its great alarm.  Added a nice Bluetooth speaker and great sound.  This morning woke up early and never opened a eye, Alexia, what time is it?  I can say show the door and get the Ring on it.  The drop-in feature allows talking to other rooms.

As I’m getting ready I can ask for the weather so now I can make sure to bring an umbrella before I leave the house. I can even view my Ring spotlight cam on it, even though it doesn’t show the full picture, I think it’s still a nice feature to have.

I haven’t explored much more than Spotify and Audible yet, but so far so good. The set-up app is not great, but it easy enough to search the FAQs for help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_65?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=65&reviewerType=all_reviews"

To be honest I was concerned about the price however very happy I paid for it. Skills are great, tells me the morning weather and traffic as I'm getting up. Morning and evening routines are easy to set up. Display screen is just the right size (I don't watch videos on this, why would you?). When I remember something that needs to be done mid day, I just say it out loud and Alexa adds it to my to do list.

Update: I’m not sure why the home card disabling didn’t do it the first try but after turning off every card the screen will no longer change which is awesome.

Works beautifully for virtually everything.  Great features, great design, great picture quality and excellent sound!

I do have a complaint... When using the device for ""drop-in"" calls, the quality is often marginal or poor audio.  Sometimes we can barely hear the other party, even with the volume at full.  Not sure why this is occurring.  Sometimes it works nicely but most of the time the drop in calls have been sub-par, sadly.  Hopefully they will improve.

Also wish this had two extra things... an extra USB port and maybe a battery backup.  Since this is intended to function as an alarm clock replacement, it seems a USB port would be a good addition (heck, maybe even two), so that you can charge your phone by your bed as well.  A battery backup would also seem like a natural addition to a device like this, but perhaps it's not necessary.  I suppose as long as you are logged into your Amazon account, perhaps it remembers your device settings...  I do not know.  At the very least it would be cool to have a battery to keep the clock working in the absence of power.

Overall GREAT device.  Very happy with our purchase!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_114?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=114&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I set my alarm for 4am and it goes off and is supposed to “according to Amazon” play the radio station continuously until I tell her to stop.  Some mornings it plays for 7 minutes, other mornings it plays for 20 minutes and sometimes it even snoozes and come back on without prompting. I complained about this several months ago and did all the troubleshooting and yet the problem still exists. Now they have dropped the ball.

Alexa lives up to what you think this technology should do.","December 30, 2017","Really, this thing is the bomb!  I have hesitated to embrace Echo.  I love Amazon and love everything about Amazon, but I find these products usually disappoint.  Like Siri, great idea, but she is just so limited and 1/2 the time she has no idea what I want her to do.  I find the pitch of my voice usually doesn't work with voice recognition products.  For example, if I call Walgreens to get a refill prescription, I usually have to press all the buttons instead of talking to it, because it gets confused.
Part of my problem with Siri and voice prompts is that I want to go too fast and they want to go too slow.  I can usually go through the prompts faster than listening to the device say everything, and I usually want to use the speaker-phone as well, that creates some delay.

Alexa is totally different.  In fact, we talk about her, so we have to call her ""the one who won't be mentioned"" because even eavesdropping on our conversations in the kitchen she will respond.  You don't have to talk loud to her, she just hears you.  The hardest thing for my husband to adjust to is when talking to Siri, you have to wait for Siri to respond.  With Alexa, you just say what you want.  You don't have to get her attention with ""Hey Alexa!""  You just say, ""Alexa drop in on Nathan's room"" and instantly you are in a speaker conversation with your son upstairs.  The quaIity is nice!  No one has to raise their voice to speak in them, just a natrual voice conversation.  I actually bought these to be an intercom system in my house.  If you have ever priced out an intercom system it is incredibly expensive!  Also, all the reviews on Amazon are horrible for every intercom system available except for Nucleus, which is $100 bucks a room.  For years I have been looking for something.  We have a landline cordless phone system in my house that I have been trying to use, but it rings in their rooms and they typically ignore it instead of answer it because they don't even know how to use regular phones anymore!
For $30 bucks a room you get all this...
-Drop in on your kids' room, you can hear everything they are doing!
-Call your kids down to dinner without yelling!
-Really!  No more yelling in the house, no more ""COMING!!!"" response.  Just ""hey, dinner is ready... ok mom, I'll be right down.""
-No more excuses about why they need their phones in their room at night.  Dots can just play any playlist they have in Prime music, Spotify or Pandora.
-No more excuses about why they need their phones as alarm clocks.  Dots can set alarms.
-No more excuses about why they didn't turn their phone in at night.  You can set a reminder to tell them to turn their phones into your room at 9pm!
-If you are in your room at night and you can hear they are still up, you can drop into their room and tell them to go to bed.  You don't have to get up!

Plus this thing does millions of other things!  In the kitchen, we have the Echo Show.  The speaker quality is good.  You can have it play any music you want.  ""Alexa, play some dinner music"" and she picks a nice play list.  ""Alexa, play some calm music"" and she picks a relaxing playlist.  ""Alexa play the Hamilton soundtrack"" and she pulls up the soundtrack and plays it, while displaying the words.  What could be easier???  I really wanted the Show for recipes in the kitchen so I didn't have to go back to my computer in the office (I know, lazy!).  You can say ""Alexa, what can I make with chicken and spinach?""  And she'll pull up recipes and even videos of the recipes.

Speaking of lazy, this thing is great.  I have the Spot in my room.  When it wakes me up in the morning I ask it to give my the daily briefing.  It tells me what is on my calendar for the day, what the weather is like outside, what the top news of the day is and what the traffic is like to work.  The only thing I wish it could do that it doesn't is have a battery so I could take it into the bathroom with me in the morning and listen to all that while I am getting ready.

Literally, we have had this for 1 day in our house, so I know it can do way more than those things, but for just that it was worth the investment.  Today I ordered 2 more dots.  One for my office and one for the basement.  Now, in every room I can have Alexa do things for me.  We don't have any smart lights or appliances, but maybe we will get some.  I can tell it to add things to my todo list as I randomly think of them during the day.  I can tell it to add things to my shopping list as I am looking in the refrigerator.  I can put things in my Amazon cart as I walk around the house instead of running to the computer and adding it to my cart.  Literally, I do almost all my shopping (outside of groceries) through Amazon, so I love having this handy device.  You can even order through Alexa.  I just like putting things in my cart and reviewing it later.

On the Spot specifically, the graphics are nice.  When it does the daily briefing it actually brings up the CNN anchor in the display.  It randomly shows things like the weather.  You can do voice/video calls with it.  The video between the Spot and the Show is nice.  For the money though, the dots work great in the kids' rooms.  I don't really need to see them.  I just need to speak with them without yelling!

If you are hesitating or on the fence, get one.  I can't believe I waited this long!  The technology has finally caught up.  It really works!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_124?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=124&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When playing music, you can read the lyrics on screen.  Helpful hints, the latest weather and news alerts all unobtrusively appear on screen, providing an additional level of interactivity.  I have yet to use any of the Spot's camera functions, but that's next on the list.

There is nothing wrong with this device. You can set the screen as bright or dark as you want. The screen goes dark automatically when the room is dark and quiet, so the ""glow"" will NOT ruin your sleep. The alarm is easily dismissed or put on snooze without having to raise your head from the pillow, or even opening your eyes, if that is your wish. Alexa can hear, and understand you in your most grogy incoherent morning self. If you can't see the screen without your glasses near, or across the room, just ASK Alexa... what time is it? What's the temperature in the room or outside? Ask what the thermostate is set to before you dare let your big toe out from under the covers. Have Alexa turn off your TV instead of fishing for the remote,  because you know, any movement you make will take you out of that ""almost asleep"" state.

I mostly use Alexa for controlling my Automation system, streaming music and occasionally some news and now with video chat drop in is cool.

What I like about the spot is that I now can play music and see the album art plus the artist and tune being played.
Also, if you manual select with your settings for automation you get a slider to control your basic devices.
If you already have Echo dots, the controls are all the same for the most part.

What I don't like:
It has been said that you can turn off the ""Try and ask Alexa"" suggestions, I don't need it and have followed others suggestions to stop it, but... There seems to have been a change to the settings within the ""Home & Clock"" option... Mine shows no ""Homecards"" rather ""Home Content"" I assume this was a change, but wait it doesn't stop there...  Instead of ""Rotate Once""... mine only shows ""Rotate Continuously"" with a slider for on or off, and guess what? my SPOT rotates the ""Try and ask Alexa"" anyway, regardless of what this setting is set for and this includes turning off all displayed content!
BTW, you might think you have solved the rotation of this annoying problem (it will lessen the frequency.. yes), but it will change and it might take awhile so you will need to wait some time to catch it changing, it might happen within a minute or it might be several minutes and this is without touching it or using commands such as the wake word. It will change and/or rotate the suggestions to ""Try and ask Alexa"" message. I have done all the suggestions that have been posted, I don't think I missed anything and yet the problem is still there and unfortunately if you do want weather or some other content to rotate you will also get the annoying message as too!

Amazon, is it not enough that I get a 10-20 emails a week and can see the opening screen on the app ""Try and ask Alexa""?

Besides this issue so far I like the unit and will probably buy another one when they are under hundred bucks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I can't put a finger on what it is about the Spot that bothers me exactly. I will say this, if you want to picture and don't; have room for the Show the Spot will suffice but if you have space and can swing the extra $$ go for the Show especially now since they have a new version. I really want to upgrade my Show for the latest version but that's another review. I will say this, and I will admit I am a little bias, I don't believe you can go wrong with any of the Echo devices, it's just a matter of selecting the style that's right for you.

I got it to replace a clunky iHome Clock Radio. I don't know why I waited so long.  First of all the design is beautiful (Hey Amazon maybe rethink the Echo Show). The option to change the clock faces and use your own photos is great. For a little orb the sound is quite satisfying. Set up was easy just like all of the Echos. The fact that I bought it when Amazon had it on sale was just the icing on the cake. At first I didn't think I'd be using so many of the Alexa commands in the Bedroom but I am.  My wife loves the ability to play some soft music with a simple command while we start to go to sleep.

Still Adorable and Smart as a Whip!","December 21, 2017","PROS: Small (~4"") Echo device with excellent voice recognition, color touch screen and camera is perfect for small places like bed-side table or kitchen counter. Good sound and image quality for such a small device. Constant software updates allow for almost limitless possibilities for uses now and in the future. In fact, many criticisms of early reviews have already been addressed and corrected.

CONS:  Not many and those that exist are, for the most part, software related and fixable by Amazon in the near future or IMHO, minor. Keep in mind that although this can play music, display videos, and make phone calls, the Spot is not a high res TV, a large entertainment center, a high fidelity listening device, or a smart phone. Expectations should be based on the fact that the Spot is a 4"" device with a 1.4"" speaker and a 2.5"" screen.

REVIEW UPDATE JULY/9/2018:
I still love the Spot. I use it for a bedside ""smart"" clock radio, and I am extremely happy with it.

What does it do? It wakes me up. It plays music. It displays the time. It answers questions, mostly about the current weather conditions.

I don't use it to teleconference, watch movies or videos, or call people's cell phones. I have the camera turned off. It's on my bedside table....Yuk! No always on camera, thank you!

As suspected, Amazon has added enhancements and fixed glitches with software upgrades. Complaints about the home screen clock face? Now there are a huge amount of customize able choices one can select. You can pick a background pattern, photo, or color, the type of clock hands or digital display, and whether there should be a tiny window for the date.

My biggest complaint is with the music it plays. I often have trouble getting Alexa to play the music I want. One has to ask Alexa properly, in the correct order. You have to say, ""Alexa, Play songs by Bonnie Raitt."" Or ""Alexa, Play songs from my Modern Blues Playlist by Bonnie Raitt."" Asking ""Alexa, Play Bonnie Raitt"" might just get a ""Sorry! There are no songs called Bonnie Raitt"" response. Things can get far trickier when you want to listen to a particular symphony by Beethoven.

Another issue is that ""Shuffle"" is not random. The shuffled songs are always played in the exact same order, every time they are played.

ORIGINAL DECEMBER 21, 2018 REVIEW:

THINGS TO KNOW:

1) The Spot has four types of controls, which often overlap in purpose and function:

a) Physical buttons on the top allow you to raise and lower the sound, turn the camera on and off.

b) Voice recognition: ""Alexa, raise the sound,"" ""Alexa, show me the current temperature,"" ""Alexa, play modern blues,""

c) Touch screen:
---Swipe down to reveal a settings menu. Spend at least a few minutes exploring this menu and filling in important information like time zone and your location. By going through each setting, you will be able to customize many if not most of Spot's offerings.
---Touch the screen when music is playing to see title of artist, various play functions, and lyrics if available.
---Touch the screen for ""snooze"" when the alarm is going off.

 d) The Alexa app which can be downloaded to your smart phone or tablet. This is not entirely necessary for the Spot.

2) If you want the Spot to do something, tell it to do it. If the clock is not showing on the screen, say ""Alexa, show the clock."" If you want to know the current temperature say ""Alexa, what is the current temperature."" If you want it to stop rotating the dopey ""Trending Topics"" screen say ""Alexa, stop showing the ""Trending Topics"" screen.""

3) The quality of the screen is pretty good but not so good that you will want to watch a full length video. It's good enough for video calling, looking at album art, reading lyrics, glancing at the temperature, following a recipe.

4) The quality of the sound is pretty good. If you consider yourself an audiophile and are looking for a top quality audio system to listen to The Emperor Concerto with Artur Rubenstein, the Spot is absolutely not going to do it for you. Also, the Spot does not sound like a Bose. If you want or need fabulous sound quality, get a Bose. If you want an all purpose, small device that sounds good, the Spot's for you.

REVIEW:
I've been looking for a bed-side clock radio for about a year and just couldn't decide on anything. Like Goldilocks, the choices were either too big/too small/or way too last century. The minute I saw the Echo Spot, my heart did a flip! It was perfect.

First of all, the Spot is darned cute...in a small, round, orb-stylish way. My bedside table has a rim around it, so I decided to purchase the Echo Spot Adjustable Stand - White which lifts the Echo up about 1 1/2"" and allows the Spot to tilt forward and back.

Set up is a snap. You plug it in, and Spot comes to life. The touch screen lights up and Spot talks to you. You pick your WiFi from a list, enter your WiFi password, and wait a minute or so while the software updates. While waiting you stare at the Spot and admire its adorableness. When the software is updated, you answer a few questions and before you know it, you and Spot are going steady and Spot has become the boss of you.

To change settings you swipe down on the screen to see the settings menu. It is important to go into Settings and set your preferences.

For now, here are six digital and six analog clock face selections for the home screen. I picked an old fashioned analog clock face with a sweep second hand and a small window for the date. You can also use a photo for the home screen.

The home screen clock alternates with several other info screens. One shows the current temperature, the time, the moon phase, and name of your city/location. Another gives suggestions of things or ""Skills"" to ask Spot to do for you. Another, which I quickly turned off, announces trending topics. I just didn't find ""Scientists find moth not seen in 10 years"" something I needed to see or even know.

Tune In Radio (which is free) provides all the radio stations I like to listen to. I ask Spot: ""Alexa, play 1010 WINS on TuneIn"" and away we go.

My only complaint is that there is an obvious bias to sign one up for Amazon Music Unlimited. Some requests for songs bump up against an advertisement for this subscription streaming service. I have a Prime membership and an Amazon Music account. That should be enough for now.

For now, Spot and I are in our honeymoon period and nothing is going to get me down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A wonderful little product to own, the Echo Spot is a powerful assistant in a sleek, small, and elegant package.  I also own the Echo Show and the Dot, so this is the latest addition to my home system.  Most of my home now runs on voice command (lights, thermostat, fans, music, entertainment system, etc.) all thanks to these fantastic devices.

Pros:
Easy to set up
Easy to pair and connect to other Alexa devices and skill devices.
Regular updates
Vast array of features and skills
Easy of use

Cons:
Home feature-based skills require more precise commands
Commands are heard and ignored (rare, but it has happened a few times)
Visibility: the display can be tough to read at a distance (10+ feet, which isn't much of a con considering the screen size)

Hand","Had I known then what I know now...","February 10, 2019","I bought this to video interface with my Ring doorbell. It does and works fine. Everything Echo related it does fine.

But, the display and its incessant switching off the analog clock to display digital time/temp and then an Alexa Tip and Trick. There are other selectable things it will also rotate thru if you choose. However, you can't shut the rotation completely off.

Some places mention a 'rotate once' selection but m!ne does not have it. There's only a switch that is 'rotation'.

The annoying thing beyond displaying unwanted Alexa tips- I know where to look if I want to know something- 95% of them I don't care about or already know!

In addition, it appears when it would display something else, the clock face display dims and flickers. It is quite aggravating as it catches my eye because it looks like something is wrong with it.

Finally, I had it turn the display completely off and moved it to another less used room and brought the old 'can' Echo back.

Had I known it did this, I would NOT have bought it. The one consolation is I didn't replace the other three Echos with video units. Apparently, they all do this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Playing music is working great for them using mostly the Pandora app I set up and the local public radio station. It didn't take long to explain it to my mom and she has the hang of it. However, it is not easy to set up people to call. Amazon says that currently, you must have a smart phone to connect to so the Echo can use your contacts list. That probably isn't going to work for my parents. I don't want to do that on mine because I don't want to give it access. Hello, Amazon?

I originally bought one to replace an alarm clock.  It functions well as a clock with voice activation of setting alarm, waking to music, etc.  If you are a Prime member you get a limited amount of music choices, and they are enough for me.  I purchased two, one for the bedroom and one for the family room.  Gradually I'm learning more things to do with Alexa, and have since purchases smart plugs to turn on and off lights.  I also purchased a dot for my office.  Alexa's screen is sufficient and I now have her connected to my Ring camera, so i don't need to go to my smartphone app to see what's going on.  Just one caution:  Don't call Alexa ""Siri"" - like all women, they get a little pissed and won't respond.

The screen adds a whole new level of interaction with Alexa. Loved that both Spots were linked to my account before I even activated them. Setup was a breeze; being able to use the touch screen instead of the Alexa app to link to Wi-Fi was much appreciated. The Spots have replaced alarm clocks in two bedrooms, and I love the fact that the display indicates when and what time an alarm is set. That was a major worry for me...not being able to tell if an alarm was set or not, but the Spot covers that issue.

I bought this simply to try an Echo device. I liked the idea of having a screen, but didn't want to fork out $229 for an Echo Show without trying a less expensive unit first, this was a good choice.  I have to admit, I felt a little strange talking to Alexa at first, but set up was easy, and now I like it.
One of the first things I did was pair it to my Spotify. I also subscribe the Amazon music for $3.99 a month. My 9-year-old loves how he can ask Alexa to play his favorite songs. I already have another Spot in my cart to put in his room. We're looking forward to ""dropping in"" on each other when he's in his room and I'm downstairs in the kitchen. I used it as an alarm this morning, and I did have a small issue with ""dismissing"" the alarm while fumbling in the dark, but I plan to try and talk to Alexa tomorrow morning to ask her to snooze or shut it off, and we'll see how it goes.

It looses 1 star because it doesn't have a battery. It needs to be plugged in all the time to work

It looses another star because Alexa struggles to understand us or plays the wrong music. Ie. We were feeling nostalgic and wanted to hear T.A.T.U. but no amout of speaking or spelling could get her to understand. She kept playing something awful called ""Lettuce"". Lol.

Another tweak I would love is to have Alexa speak to me in a British accent while still registering my speech as U.S. English but no stars lost for that. I posted something to that effect and it seems other people want this to so here's hoping for an update!

If you're a Star Wars fan, try these for a laugh.
""Alexa, I am your Father""
""Alexa, who's your favorite Star Wars character?""

And for bonus laughs ask her favorite color. Whoever writes these jokes for Alexa is nailing it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Annoying software.","May 30, 2018","After the first day, I have to say this is a beautiful piece of hardware. As with all Echo devices you get much more than you pay for. Footprint is comparable to an Echo Dot. The device is hefty on ought to stay put on the table, feels rock solid, and image quality is beautiful. Sound quality is surprisingly good... not up to a full-size Echo, of course, but close enough for most puposes. I would be totally in love, if only...

By default, the display rotates through various pages, including clock, weather summary, ‘things to try’, and ‘trending’. Various other pages can be enabled or disabled, but this option is not available for these basic four pages. And that is a serious problem. Not quite a show-stopper for me, but a serious problem.

I was an Echo early adopter. I got one of the first devices out the door, and have acquired several more. Alexa runs my whole house, plays my music, tells me jokes, chats with me, places occasional phone calls for me, gives me the weather, and much more. I get frequent emails from Amazon suggesting additional ‘things to try’ and new Alexa features.

I do NOT want to wake up in the middle of the night, glance at the Spot on my nightstand, and sit through ‘things to try’ and ‘trending’ to see what time it is!!!

Admittedly Amazon does give you the option to stop page rotation entirely. There is an ‘only once’ setting that rotates through all the screens once only, then stops on the clock screen. But some of the other screens look useful. I can’t imagine that it would be hard to provide software toggles for ‘things to try’ and ‘trending’, just like the toggles provided for the other supplementary screens. And, yes, I know that Alexa is always evolving and getting smarter, but this has apparently been a hot-button issue for many disappointed users for a long time, going back to the early days of Echo Show, with no response from Amazon.

The ability to freeze the display on the clock is good enough for me, for now, but the device could be so much more useful with this one minor tweak!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Rachel was patient and helpful.  She emailed an extended list of things to try with Alexsa.

Not user friendly at all.  It keeps on posting useless skills the spot can do when it can't do its primary function well at all. It doesn't understand any of my commands for alarms when it comes to what I want it to play.  The clock designs are subpar and so are the alarm sounds.  Seriously, I don't need to be woken up to Alec Baldwin!  And it seems like the volume goes back up over the day.  I should also be able to set my alarms manually with more details and options like I can on my iPhone.  I usually like Amazon Echo products, but this one has too many flaws for the price.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_103?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=103&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is an excellent bedside ""smart home"" companion but it is equally at home on a desktop.  I've been steadily adding to my Echo collection since I pre-ordered the original Echo before they became available.  The Spot is the most useful overall especially because it can easily be paired/connected to a better speaker so open spaces like a kitchen are also a good fit for the Spot.  The set-up is simple and seamless.  Generally, I think people who are disappointed or otherwise disillusioned with the Spot are so because they don't take the time to fully tailor the Alexa app and Echo so it can best learn their preferences.  If you want the most out of the Spot it does take an investment of time to set-up your voice profile, and learn about and try some Skills unique to the Spot.  There's just more to it than a basic installation and expectation it can do anything imaginable.  The challenge is to take the time to experiment with it a little to prevent a ""now what?"" moment.  It's not perfect, but I for one really like the direction Amazon is going in with the Spot.  I knocked off a star because the Spot would be perfect if the screen could somehow stretch from bezel to bezel.  It's not that it's too small to be worthwhile, but that little bit of extra screen would go a long way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Although the Cube was an epic fail, I think Amazon got it right with the Echo Spot.

The small profile but big sound is a definite plus. I like that I can use it as a bedside clock for my room as well as my guest bedroom (I did the 2fer deal). My company loves it. All the good music it streams, the news, and if you don’t mind squinting a bit, you can watch a good movie.
I wish Amazon would buy back all of my other Echo items (minus my original Echo) and replace them with the Spot.
If you were on the fence about purchasing, throw your hesitation out the window. You won’t be disappointed.  I Gar-On-Tee!! LOL!!
Last note:  As always, the packaging was stellar and the Spot worked right out of the box. So if you are considering a purchase for elderly parents or grandparents, they won’t have a problem figuring it out. Plus, it starts up with a basic tutorial.

The sound is ok, could be improved, maybe a little more bass, but the overall volume is loud enough for a bedroom or kitchen. Alexa responds quickly, no hiccups here, the screen is bright, clear and automatically adjusts to the light in the room.

I previously had an Echo Dot, which has moved to another room. The spot makes a great alarm clock, in particular because you can enable the ""ascending alarm"" feature which ramps the volume up slowly (starting from zero, with alarm message only displayed on screen). This is exactly what I've always wanted. I might decide to power the device through a small UPS in case of power failure, since (unlike a normal clock) it has no battery backup.

One major annoyance -- there's a bug in the app (at least the iOS version?) which prevents proper positioning and cropping of a custom background image. Regardless of how you set it up, the image is displayed way off to the side. I've reported this to Alexa support twice so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This means my wife and I can't really use it as a bedside clock like we'd originally intended since we can't trust it to actually be showing the time.

I would love to return this thing, now that I've realized what this thing is - a billboard for you to use other services you don't want - I really don't like it. If they got it to stop showing ""Things to Try"" every 7 minutes, it would be much more useful and I'd change my review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I've had at least one of each model except Echo Look. This is my favorite. It is on my nightstand, serving as clock, alarm, evening music player, white noise generator, Audible book player, and general companion. The screen makes everything better. I also have an Echo Show, which was on my nightstand, but it functions better in my kitchen when I need cooking help. I am a clock fan, and the faces available are great. Its like having an old-timey clock, but lighted. You can adjust the brightness. Oh yeah, it's a touch screen, too. So you wake up in the middle of the night, and Spot is ""Spot on"" with the time. Or you're lying on your side facing away--""Alexa, what time is it?"" The screen also shows what time your alarm will sound.
Have you ever awoken with a good idea, but know you won't remember in the morning? ""Alex, take a note."" Is your favorite song playing, but you've forgotten the words? Alexa often knows the lyrics and scrolls them while the song plays.
You can also ""drop in"" on folks. My Spot is set for household only. So if the grandson isn't up yet--Let's call the grandson Billy--""Alexa, drop in on Billy."" A sound alerts Billy, then you see on his Spot, he's still asleep. ""Billy, get up, get ready for school.""
Like all the Alexas, Spot has so many uses, and the screen just makes it better. My favorite Alexa device. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_169?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=169&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Keep in mind that there is no battery back-up. (I have mind plugged in to a small UPS.)  Also, as with any video device in the home, you will want to tune your Drop-in settings for privacy.

For me this was a smart buy, I already own 2 echo dots and a Google Home. I needed/wanted something with a screen. Will eventually get an Echo Show when the price drop but this will do for now.

Should you get it? Why not? See your new flash briefings, watch videos and see your security cameras all on one device.

It has become my new alarm clock.  There are just a few problems that cause it for now to be 3 stars. First, setting the alarm and turning it off can be quite hard, especially if you try to shut it off with a touch.  You also have to use the exact word, STOP!, to make it shut off  for that day., or if you say anything else will shut it off permanently.  Also, the weekday alarm does not work at all. If you set it for weekday, after the first day it just doesn't work. When I check the iOS Alexa app, it shows that the weekday alarm is on, but the Spot doesn't recognize that it is still on, and misses it the next day. The only way to get the weekday alarm to work at all is to turn off and then back on for it to work. I have found a workaround for my problem. I have set up five separate alarms for Monday through Friday to get what one weekday setup should have done. Yes, I did contact Amazon, but they still haven't fixed the problem. This isn't a new problem if you search the web. Hopefully the software will be fixed soon so I can change my rating to higher.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We keep one in our bedroom, which I use as a Bluetooth speaker for my Kindle Fire as well as for checking the weather, etc. The other is in the main level of our house, and we use it to play background music, and as a Bluetooth speaker for my Kindle Fire when I'm nearby. But my office has had an Echo Dot, which was great because I don't have much horizontal surface area on my desk.

Last week I succumbed to a trade-in offer from Amazon and bought an Echo Spot to replace the Dot. I wasn't sure I wanted or needed a screen to go with my Echo device, but the offer was too good to pass up. I am really surprised how much I like having the Spot and its small screen. I just tried voice ordering for the first time, and it was really reassuring to have the visuals to go with the ordering process. I'm sold! I look forward to listening to my Audible audio books and Kindle books, and having the touch screen to better control playback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My one and only complaint, however: The volume. I need an external speaker for it because the alarm simply does not get loud enough to wake me up on its own. I've been using my cell phone to wake myself up for awhile now and I feel like my phone is louder. Additionally, I've got to kind of shout for it to hear me as well. This isn't an issue I have with generation 1 echo at all.

Regardless, I feel that once I get a speaker for it'll basically be perfect for my needs. Hopefully they can address this in future version.

Mainly it is the most beautiful excellent alarm clock ever. I purchased it on Prime day and took advantage of a ten-dollar smart plug add-on purchase, so I can also command it to make my coffee.

It is the best, latest addition I have added to my home. Echo even has a sense of humor with some of her responses and the pictures and visible information are a plus, not to mention the BT speaker feature. The background photo can be changed to one of choice from my own albums and I did easily figure out how to stop the screens from constantly scrolling.  It is in the settings, just as some folks have answered in the FAQs. There are many more neat features, but I don’t want to spoil a future owner’s fun in discovering them on his/her own. Oh, i do also love the lists and reminders. Just ask Alexa to add an item to your shopping or to-do list or an item to your reminders and she will take care of the rest.

One BIG drawback for me.","July 3, 2018","Heed the other reviews.  I DO NOT appreciate being subjected to ad-ware and pop-ups on-line and I equally despise intrusive advertising that I cannot turn off which unfortunately is the case with the Echo Spot.  I was sufficiently concerned from reading other reviews that I reached out to Amazon customer service to confirm (on-line chat) to confirm prior to purchase.  I am very sorry to report that they lied to me.  I was told in no uncertain terms that I could turn off the Alexa suggestions ""things to try"".  I carefully followed their directions on how to do that but it DOES NOT WORK AS CLAIMED.  It would stop for a while and then revert.  Every time I look, the setting to ""rotate once"" has switched back to the default and the ""things to try"" will not stop.  Had I known this in advance, I would not have purchased even on sale.

Amazon, I already bought the product; quit forcing me to put up with your sales pitch on all the things I can do!  My opinion, and trust level, with Amazon has suffered a real hit due to this.

The GOOD:
Aside from the one non-adjustable ""feature"", this thing is potentially a great product.  I use it as an alarm clock and it can't be beat.  The customizable clock face is great, the auto brightness adjustment is spot on and the size is perfect.  I can't stand clocks that are overly bright in a dark room and I'm happy to say that this one is not a problem at all.  I really want to love this thing and all it would take to get me there is for Amazon to make it behave the way customer service claims it will.  I'm waiting (like many others) for the firmware fix to address that most annoying feature.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_133?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=133&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The burden of having to touch the Spot to place orders on Amazon (physically interacting with it) is weird considering we've been using the DOT for a year or more hands-free was great and easy. Now you can't re-order anything without touching to select it.
Over all I'd say pass on this one. I don't know of the full-size SHOW works the same way so don't extend this review to the SHOW, but for us, we're going to replace the Spot with the old ECHO DOT we were using previously as aside from the Temperature being displayed, it adds nothing beneficial, and removes some ease-of-use features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_496?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=496&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was easy to set  up too. I love it and how it looks. The sounds quality is great for such a small device.
However, I am having alot of issues getting things to work that I expect to work... like, playing prime video on the echo- just does not work. Or, asking when the next bus is due... It cant do it. Or, asking when my amason delivery is due to arrive.. It told me I had no 'open orders' which was just wrong. And- i must say, I am dissapointed with the 'skills'. It is a far cry from what is possible with Android Apps and Google assistant.... It pretty poor. AND I cant view what Skills Ive 'enabled'!!! It's sooooooo annoying.
You're probably wondering why I got this then instead of a Google assistant device. 1. my boyfriend had the dot and it responded to my voice reallly well, much better than Google assistant on my google phone. I have an Irish accent which devices can have trouble with, so this was a big attraction. 2. It was really easy to use- as an alarm, to get weather updates, play music, adjust the volume etc. I imagined a Google device would have more trouble recognizing my commands.

So....its still cool and functional as a above average alarm clock, and voice command usic player (this is just damn handy), and i can use it to call family and have my phone and hands free. This is what I like about it. For &$90, I can live with that.
I will be contacting Amazon to get the issues fixed and will follow up here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

1.  I have to go into the Alexa app to set the home screen picture - logical as I need to select the photo from my phone and it uploads to the Spot.  But if I make any changes to the display setting on the Spot touchscreen itself, it erases my custom homescreen photo.  I have to go back to the Alexa app to re-install.  Not a killer but annoying.
2.  I appreciate the nighttime setting so the clock face dims - but the numerals for the time as way too small.  You have the screen real estate so why not offer a big type option where my clock can be in numbers 1.25 inches tall or more?  then I can see them without putting back on my glasses.
3.  Another clock request:  you have built a global product - why not offer 24-hour military time as an option?

But still AWESOME!","May 4, 2018","I deducted one star for the speaker level. All though the speaker is crystal clear and very smooth, it could be louder. I believe it only has a 2 watt speaker. As I am a heavy sleeper, it’s not quite loud enough to always wake me up. I bought the stand for it and that helps a little.
Alexa seems to respond well, to pretty much everyone. This includes when I’m watching YouTube on another device and someone says “Alexa” on the video. Also when watching TV.
A lot of the skills are crap, but there are some that are top notch.
Alexa doesn’t always hear you correctly either or get confused with what your asking. I had the best argument with her the other night. Lol
The spot works very well, it’s intuitive. I had a glitch with the screen not switching back to home. A simple restart was all that I needed to fix it.
This is a great little device, I plan on giving them out for holidays and birthdays this year.
On the price... $129.99 seems a little high. They were on sale for $109.99 when I purchased mine, and that’s not as painful. For the higher price, I think they should include the stand that currently sells for $19.99.
Alexa vs Siri? Hands down, Alexa! And I’m a huge Apple fan with lots of HomeKit stuff. BTW, most HomeKit stuff works with Alexa.
I could go on and on with this review but you’ll just have to get one and draw your own conclusions about it. Wait for the sales though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This was my first foray into a digital assistant that's not on my phone. The number of 'skills' you can enable for it is mind boggling. I started with having it control our bedside lights. Of course there's all the usual alarms, weather, general knowledge searches, even games (I particularly like True or False. It'll make a statement and ask if you think it's right. It also keeps score. Great way to pick up interesting facts). I've also connected it to my Arlo security camera. So I just need to say, ""Alexa, show me the front door"", and I can see it on the little screen. I use it to play music a lot. The Amazon music service is great, especially as it usually shows lyrics too. But I often also use Pandora. So I say something like ""Alexa, play alternative 80s on Pandora"", and she does!

This does so many more awesome things that outweighs this one tiny negative feature. With the Alexa app, you can “drop in” on your house, talk to people in it and even video chat with the spot.

It serves its purpose well and I like how much more intuitive it is with its screen. For an alarm clock it works very well for me, I don't listen to music on it since it's not really meant for that in my opinion but for watching movie trailers and such I like it. Like everyone else has stated there really should be an option to turn off the things to try home card, I don't need that showing at all. Maybe/hopefully with a future update that will be addressed. Also, I think there should be an option to have the display turn off/time out after a certain amount of time or inactivity. There really is no need to have it on all the time, I'm at work for 9 hours of the day anyway.. You can turn the display off by asking it but I'd rather not have to do that everytime I leave the room. Also, they should add an option for how long your snooze sessions are. My last concern is with the alarm, I came across the situation where my power went out and I'm assuming if it hadn't turned back on I would not have been woken up by the alarm. Maybe in a future iteration they could implement a backup battery so the alarm sounds in the event of power loss? Other than those small gripes I do enjoy the Echo Spot and if you're looking for a smart alarm clock I highly recommend you pick one up. Especially when they have deals, I was able to pick mine up for $109.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately the Echo Spot has not lived up to their usual stellar delivery. I decided to get one earlier this year and waited for many months for the black Friday price. It has been a surprising disappointment.

Despite having numerous clock faces to choose from, not a single one includes the temperature display. I can't even imagine what the rationale was for that.

I thought it would be nice to display background photos, but the photos are so dim as to be invisible. I haven't been able to figure out how to make them brighter.

Another big disappointment is that the volume settings have much bigger jumps in the lower range, at least over the 3.5 mm audio jack. Volume level II is barely audible and III is too loud. That was not the case with my Echo gen II.
Another volume issue is that the media plays at one volume, while Echo responses to commands are at a much higher volume. Presumably that is adjustable, but I haven't been able to figure it out yet.

One of the main reasons I thought that the Echo Spot would be really cool was so that I could stream a video while laying in bed. It can kind of do that, but I quickly learned that the video commands don't work for the most part. If I say Pause, it doesn't pause. If I say 'start from the beginning', it says I can't do that. If I say Rewind, it says that command is not available. If I say Stop, it just keeps playing. If I say Cancel, it just keeps playing. When I say 'next episode', Alexa begins playing the next song from the last Pandora station I was listening to. The streaming video function is almost completely useless.

I haven't tried making a video call because I don't know anyone else who has an Echo Spot. So that feature is virtually useless to me.

So as much as I hate to, I have to give it a one star rating compared to the Echo that I hoped to replace.

Update:  Customer service called me (stellar service as always!), I enjoyed talking with them.  They told me all of those issues are known issues with the Echo Spot, and they are alerting the developers.  (Although the video command failures seemed like a surprise to them).

So i'm returning the Spot.  I wanted to love it, but it wasn't loving me back.  I did find a nice alternative.

I bought a google home hub, which does the things the Spot doesn't do.  Then I found I could connect the home hub to an Echo Dot via bluetooth, allowing media to play from the home hub and the Dot onto my stereo system, giving me great sound from both devices, and the functionality of both.  (the home hub has mediocre sound and no 3.5 mm jack).  Kudos to Amazon for the Dot, which has both bluetooth and a 3.5 mm jack, full Alexa capability, and costs a fraction of all those other devices.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.

The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:

-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.
-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see ""Things to Try"" whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off?

I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_266?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=266&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wish that there was a collection similar to the Sony Dash Apps or Chumby widgets available to use as home cards. I particularly miss having local weather radar cycle along with clock, weather information, and the news. I could do without the Alexa suggestions card displaying, or maybe I just haven't figured out how to turn it off from rotation. At any rate, a little more Chumby-like would go a long way in enhancing the usefulness of the touch screen in my opinion. For instance, maybe one could customize a number of different home screens, giving them a time range to remain activated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_158?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=158&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen is nice and clear. I love the options for the background. I like that I can tell it to set an alarm and the next morning I can either tap the screen to snooze or slide up to stop - I don't have to tell it to stop and wake my husband. I like that I can ask it to show me who's at the front door and it'll access my Ring doorbell/camera so I can decide if I feel like getting up to answer it. I love that it has all the same functionality as the echo dots but with added visuals - for example, if I'm playing music, it shows the album art in the background. The sound quality is pretty good, so I haven't felt the need to attach a bluetooth speaker. My one and only concern is someone hacking the camera and watching me sleep or change clothes. It's easy enough to turn around, but I never think about it, so I guess I'm not THAT worried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

CONS:
- plugin is huge
- screen is a circle so watching videos is a bit difficult

PROS:
- light sensing - dims and brightens as needed
- I can personalize with photos
- I can check my Amazon orders
- can connect to my Spotify (premium only)/Pandora account
- an amazing alarm clock

Echo keeps my kids amused for hours as well too, they even ask Alexa to tell them jokes lol.

Soar","Some useful features, just a little expensive for what I use it for. YMMV.","February 11, 2018","I like it but I don't love it. Love the small footprint and the shape, combined with the screen. The screen, about the size of my cell phone, is not something I'd watch videos on. Even on our larger Show I don't watch videos. The speaker quality is so-so, quite tinny. Yes, I could hook up a  speaker, but I bought this for a tight space. Currently using it mostly as an expensive clock/weather device, a grocery list generator, appointment calendar and an intercom (the intercom feature is quite useful and works anywhere we have a device - up stairs, downstairs, basement, shop).

I like the new wake to music feature, wish it would start at lower volume and then get louder - then it would be useful in the bedroom.

Our other issue is that we are running out of useful names, lol. We already had two ""Alexa"" and an ""Echo"" and naming the device in our office ""Computer"" was fun but a disaster, as far as saying the wake work too often. ""Her"" hearing is quite good and you have to have quite a bit of separation to use the same name. More names, please.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I notice the microphone sometimes do have some misses compare to the first gen Echo dot but it still work better than the second gen Echo dot I have. With the display It make it a nice device to be placed in living room as a clock providing simple information like local temperature, trending news which sometimes I am lazy to ask Alexa. The two things I wish it’s better....

1. the width of bezel is quite wide but I assuming this is a technology Limitation which hopefully be overcome on next generation.
2. I wish they will later add a button or way to easily get the device back to home screen when user is using touch screen instead of using voice which seem odd when I am using touch screen. Maybe I missed out a way to do it on touch screen which hopefully someone can let me know how.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_207?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=207&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Nice to have new 21st century tech.  Overall it's a fantastic product, but the text size and video can come across dark sometimes making it a little hard to see.  Also the internal speaker sounds a little flat. I added a Logitech Z50 coffee mug size speaker to it and now it sounds much better. I have it paired the 2 Echo Spots with my 2nd Gen Echos and have a nice sounding whole household sound system. Optionally I can play news and music on it separately if I'm in one of the bedrooms.

Ponder","Nice","March 28, 2018","Solid device but does have room for improvement. Purchased to replace my bedside alarm clock and so far it has worked out nicely. I do wish there was a larger digital clock face and a button to dismiss the alarm. Currently, when an alarm goes off you can tap to snooze or swipe up to dismiss the alarm. Problem is that if you get out of bed before the alarm goes off, there is no way to dismiss it other than telling Alexa to dismiss the alarm. This isn't a grand option if your wife is still asleep.

I do like having the ability to check my Ring cameras from the Spot. Would like to have a built-in cover for the camera. And wouldn't mind getting severe weather alerts from the Spot (might have this ability but yet to find it).

All in all a great Echo device and not too shabby of a bedside alarm clock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_45?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=45&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I replaced an original Echo with the Echo Spot.

Setup was quick as easy with the Alexa App. There is some additional configuration that can be done on the device to change the clock face and home screen background. All together it took less than 15 minutes to set up and install the latest software.

Setting up my recurring alarms was easy using the Alexa app. The Clock face shows the time that the alarm is set for, this is helpful for quickly seeing if the alarm you are expecting is enabled. When the alarm goes off, the display gives a huge advantage over a regular Echo. You can snooze the alarm by clicking on the screen or swipe up to dismiss the alarm instead of having to talk to Alexa.

I was originally concerned that the display would be distracting / too bright at night. Thankfully, the screen gets very dim and switches to a digital clock with red text when not actively being used. It's not too bright and easy on the eyes when glancing at in a dark room.

Similarly to the Echo Show during the day the display scrolls through some trending articles or suggested actions to try. I always like to see these and it's a nice feature.

Overall I have been happy with the device so far!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have several echo devices through the house and love the multi room music feature.  It is on everyday. When the Show came out, I bought one for my bed stand.  It was fine but a little big. Plus, when you do multi room music, the show will only play on it's internal speaker and I had a nice pair of powered bookshelf speakers I wanted to use.  It switched back and forth constantly if it was streaming multi room, just this device, etc.  The new Spot has a 3.5mm speaker jack, so that is no longer an issue.  All audio comes out of my speakers.  The size of the Spot is perfect for the bed stand and even with my fuzzy vision without glasses, I can easily see what time it is at night. Note to Amazon: We still need the ability for an Echo device to be in more than one multi-room music group!  Right now, if you have an ""everywhere"" group and put all your devices in it, you can not then do an upstairs or a downstairs or an outside group.  Multi-room music is great!

First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.
What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating.

My father is 85, nearly deaf, battling dementia and has recently dealt with the death of my mother.  He feels alone and isolated.  In setting up the echo, I was asked by Alexa if I wanted to try the one month of amazon music unlimited for free.  I said yes.

We removed the card on file so that no random charges were made either by amazon or more importantly by my father as he learns to work with the spot.

On Jan. 1st, (2 weeks after I received the device) I began receiving emails that in the attempt to renew my subscription, they had problems.  When I contacted customer service to ask why they were trying to bill me, they first said they would bill and then refund the amount for the 30 days (Harley told me this).  Heidi then told me that they just happened to notice that the card was not working (there was no card to work).  I then asked to speak to a supervisor.  Joey A then got on the phone and tried to say that the emails were a mistake that the wrong ones were sent.  I asked him to explain then why the free trial was canceled.  He told me they need to validate a card.  I asked where it says I do not have the right to remove a card at any time I choose, and where it says that Amazon has the right to bill me whenever they want.

I was told it doesn't matter, that if I refuse, then they will not fulfill their agreement.

1. Hey Amazon, make this so that it is NOT tied to a power cord.....Recharge at night is OK, but give us the opportunity to move it around as the camera does NOT pick up a decent wide angle
2. What's the deal with the camera function not being able to choose between YES accept video call or NOT? I mean, give us the choice to reject a video call but take an audio call
3. I am having trouble finding if the camera is ALWAYS on and therefore any incoming video call AUTO accepts

Finally decided to get a proper Echo device on Black Friday, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm using it all the time now and it's making my life easier with helping with reminders for being a caretaker for my mother with meds, scheduling, PT, and all other types of things. It's also great for when looking things up and easily pulling up my Spotify or Audible books when I have a bit of downtime.

I'm just scratching the surface of the Alexa skills, and there are so many fun and helpful things to choose from. I picked up an additional speaker only echo dot for my mom's room, and am slowly converting some of our household electronics into smart options. Just got the Phillip Hue bulbs installed - they're great and will give my mom some more independence and we've got smart plugs on the way. They also work with the Wyze cameras we recently installed. We've got one of them set up like a video baby monitor so we can check on her without having to wake her up all night or if her bed alarm goes off and we need to see if she got up on her own (she has a tendency to fall) or just rolling over.

I ordered this screen protector with it and it's a perfect fit and provides privacy/security from the camera.

- It was easy to setup
- Desktop web app is nice
- One setup for all Alexa devices
- Very responsive

Tips: Get to know Skills and Routines. As well as Smart Home Devices, Groups and Scenes.

CONS
- Assistant isn't very good at answering questions
- No way to Drop In from the smartphone app
- Can't delay commands
- Built-in Custom responses only, so can't create custom responses
- Can't change use custom trigger Wake Up names or voices to anything but Alexa, Computer, Echo, Amazon
- Doesn't support Google Play Music service
- Doesn't support Skype, Hangouts, Telegram, etc.
- Scenes can be disabled from the mobile app, but not from desktop
- You can link a Google Calendar and asked what is scheduled for particular day as well as add appointments
- Since Google and Amazon are fighting, of course there's no way to play YouTube
- Asking Alexa to play a specific song on iHeartRadio never plays the correct song
- Unless you have a Spotify subscription don't expect many targeted music choices
- I asked Alexa some basic questions pertaining to an Amazon subscription, to which she couldn't answer. What benefit's are included in a basic Amazon membership? What benefit's are included in an Amazon non-prime membership? What's included with an Amazon Prime Membership? LOL
- Beware that as others have reported the integration with the Skybell HD is not a all what you would expect, as it does NOT alert the Echo Spot to motion detection or doorbell press. Even when you say ""Alexa tell Skybell to record video"" no video shows on the Echo Spot. Don't expect anything other than a simple Dot functionality!!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_389?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=389&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.

I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.

Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.

The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.

The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.

The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.

Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The reason for only three stars is when I play my Amazon Prime music subscription on the spot, the lyrics will only stay on the screen a very short time and I have to keep telling it to show lyrics or get the lyrics back by touching the screen.  This is one of the main reasons I purchased this is so I can have the lyrics to the music I'm listening to.  I have tried to change all the setting available but nothing fixes this problem.  I can only hope Amazon reads some of these reviews and does a software update to take care of this problem.  Not keeping my fingers crossed though.  Its a shame that the money I spent on this has this fatal flaw.  If I wanted to listen to music without lyrics I would just keep listening to music on my Echo.

We can say, ""show me the front door"" and answer the Nest video doorbell without any issues.  We also control the thermostats in the house as well as all of the Caseta and Phillips Hue lights throughout the house.  The news feed service as well as other services through amazon are truly excellent.  I use the google assistant for informational issues and complex computing tasks, etc.  I always get an answer from Google.  Alexa is about 50% effective for informational issues, but excellent for home control.  Music is okay, but mediocre.

Additionally, it's tiny, makes a great alarm clock (and dims to the perfect brightness at night), and is able to do all the neat tricks like visualizing lyrics as songs play. Sound quality is good enough, and just like any Echo device, it will connect with a better speaker via Bluetooth if that's not good enough for you.

I'm also fairly happy with the news content it pushes at me; it always seems to find a story I'm interested in, with video available if I ask it to show me a particular topic it's suggested. And, of course, all the little suggestions and tips on how to use Alexa features you may not have heard of. Easily ignored, but there if you care.

If I had more than one, I'd probably have something to say about the video chat, but I don't. Same for compatible cameras; I hear it's good for that sort of thing, but who knows.

Replacement clocks were either too large or too small ... or, were bedroom alarm clocks.  I read the reviews and knew that I was getting into with the SPOT -- NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.  I bought it anyway because I liked the form factor.  Everything the negative reviews related are true.  Awaken it with any request and it cycles through ""cards"" of perfectly useless and, from a distance, unreadable screen dribble such as Trending News and long lists of things SPOT can do.  You can't read the time until the dribble is over.

Using the Internet, I learned how to selectively start turning off features in an attempt to stop the screen dribble.  I only left the ability to ask SPOT to the tell us the weather ... and then the screen dribble started again.  SOLUTION: Turn off EVERYTHING.  Now SPOT is a $99 dumb clock without screen dribble that interferes with our ability to tell the time.  For us, that's okay.  SPOT sits close to two ECHO PLUSES + Subwoofer tied into a fantastic, networked stereo system for Amason Prime music.  ""Alexa"" via the Echo Pluses can give us everything we need from those devices.

SPOT met our minimum requirement for a  nice looking but expensive $99 dump clock to sit atop one of our stereo speakers.  Rating as a dumb clock FIVE STARS.  Rating as an ""Alexa"" device ONE STAR ... and that is being very charitable.  Looking forward to SPOT updates to someday make the new clock fit/network in with our other ""Alexa"" devices.  That aside, it is a very, very nice looking dumb clock.  Highly recommended for its aesthetic qualities.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am using it as a replacement for my bedroom alarm clock and it is just so much better than an old school alarm clock. And I don't have to change to daylight savings time twice a year anymore. Hallelujah!

This is a sturdy, elegant looking little Echo unit with a dazzling screen! There are about two dozen clock faces to choose from, digital or analog and they are all beautiful … my favorite is “High Contrast” because it looks like watercolors. Amazon is adding new clock faces all the time too.

I used to have to fiddle with the controls on my alarm clock to change the alarm time. Now I just tell Alexa to ""set an alarm for 9am"" and she sets a one-time alarm for me. If you want to wake up every day at 9am just say ""recurring"" when you set the alarm. She does everything for you.

""Show my alarms"" or ""show my reminders"" will list your alarms and reminders on the screen.

Of course, the Spot does so much more than this... listen to music, ask questions, get the news and weather, show the front door camera (if you have a security camera that works with Alexa), video calling, text messaging, calendar, play sleep sounds to fall asleep to (my favorite is ""play train sounds""). I don't know why but the clickity clack of rail cars puts me to sleep... maybe because I grew up right next to train tracks when I was a kid in Chicago. There are so many other sleep sounds to choose, from frogs and crickets, to rain, thunderstorms, and ocean waves just to name a few.

Anyway, I can't say enough good things about the Echo Spot ... I own two Echo Shows, and one Echo Spot. And I love them all! The Echo Show plays music with incredible speakers and actually shows the album cover of the song being played. I use Pandora for music on the Spot and Show but you can choose from Amazon Music, Spotify, and many others!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Video chat lag.","January 5, 2019","Great device for Alexa features such as music and displaying recipes on the screen. However, this is horrible when it comes to video chat. I own two Nucleus devices which are hardwired Power Over Ethernet. Video connection is instant with no lag. The Spot has a delay during video chat and it takes a while to establish the connection. Why is there no Ethernet port on this device? Why can't I video chat with the Nucleus or vice versa? Amazon claims they believe in giving people options, but they have severely restricted the features on non Amazon devices. Now I have to make a choice between Amazon devices or Nucleus for an intercom system. The reliabilIty of the Nucleus is a strong winning point.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_122?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=122&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No more having to shout down the stairs and try to be heard over the home theater system, now she just tells it to call the Echo Dot in the theater room when she needs to get my attention!

After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think.

As a stroke survivor, I love that the devices can be used as an indoor intercom system if I need help. I also love that I can ask Alexa to add an item to different lists, like a To Do list and Grocery List from anywhere in the house. I don’t have to worry about forgetting because it’s done in an instant.

Now to the Echo Spot:

Compact, easy to use and program, excellent alarm clock!

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player This an excellent addition to the Echo line, but could still use a few improvements. I have the original Echo and a few of the Echo Dots, and have had no problem at all setting them up. I bought the Echo Spot to use in my bathroom instead of a clock radio. We live in a rural area, and the reception on the radio is not always the greatest. I wanted the music that I can get from the clock radio and also the clock since I always seem to play ""beat the clock"" in my daily routines.

I consider myself to be quite tech savvy, so I generally don't require any help in setting up electronics. Even so, I did have a couple of problems in setting up the Echo Spot that required a couple of phone calls to Amazon tech support. Hopefully my experience will help someone else in setting up their Echo Spot. Initially, I had a hard time getting the unit to accept my network password even though I thought I was entering the correct password. I called tech support on this but eventually figured out the problem myself. When entering the password, the last position you enter is dimmed so it looks like you didn't enter it. Because of this, I was initially entering the last position of the password twice. Once I realized the last position was dimmed, I was able to connect to our network with no problems.

The other problem that I had was that the display for setup required a tap and then a double tap to get into menus. Once into a menu, it required a 3-finger swipe to move up or down in the menus. In talking to tech support, I found out that this was a  default option in the accessibility settings. To enable 1-finger selection and swiping, the accessibility for VoiceView Screen Reader/ VoiceView must be turned off. Once this is done, 1-finger selection and scrolling of the menus works. It seems to me that 1-finger selection and scrolling should be the default since most people are familiar with the use of tablets.

Other than this couple of gripes, I love the Echo Spot. It has all of the functionality of the Dot and full sized Echo (other than the speakers), and also includes a screen for multiple functions. Although the display is small, and you probably wouldn't want to watch a video on it, you could if you wanted to. For better sound, it is very easy to connect a Bluetooth or wired speaker to it, but in a small room, the speakers are more than sufficient. For my purposes, it replaces a clock radio that often doesn't have good reception and had added so many other features that I didn't have with the radio. I am getting so spoiled with the ability to turn lights off or on, play music that I like, set timers, and even find programs on my TV with the Fire Stick. Now that I have discovered the Echo Spot, I will likely find more places in my house that require me to purchase more of them.

UPDATE 05/14/18:
When I bought the first Echo Spot, I had it on my computer desk for the initial setup, and didn't move it into my new bathroom until the room was finished. When I did move it to my bathroom, I missed having the one on my desk, so I had to order another one for my desk. I loved having a handy clock not to mention that I could use it to find content on my Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote | Streaming Media Player. In the meantime, I have also added OontZ Angle 3 ULTRA : Portable Bluetooth Speaker 14-Watts deliver Bigger Bass and Hi-Quality Sound, 100ft Wireless Range, Play two together for Music in Dual Stereo, IPX-6 Splashproof Black to my bathroom Spot, and very much enjoy the stereo sound on them. Since the Spot is so small, the sound isn't the greatest, but the addition of the speakers adds a whole different dimension to the sound. I have to say that I am enjoying all of our Echo products, and it is so easy to get spoiled with all that they have to offer. The Echo products are constantly evolving and only get better with time. The only criticism that I can think of at this time is that the plug take enough space that the outlet next to it is not usable. It would be nice if the plug were a bit smaller. It might also be nice if the option of using an A/C plug or USB was an option as some of the multi-plugs available now offer the ability to plug in USB devices. In increased the rating to 5 stars since I didn't have to do anything special to use the second Spot to accept one click for selections. This may have been due to an update. I enjoy the Spot because it sometimes makes me smile with answers to silly questions. A smile in the day can be a good thing!!

UPDATE 01/17/19:
I am still loving the Spot in my bathroom especially since I have connected stereo Bluetooth speakers to it. The only problem that I have encountered is that I sometimes have to restart it to get a different connection to my router. Since buying the first Spot, I also bought one for my computer desk in the family room. It has all the functionality of the Echo and works perfectly as a desk clock that I never have to reset if the electricity goes out. I don't use this one to play music, but occasionally use it to help find available movies on Amazon and to turn Alexa enabled devices on and off. This is a wonderful device to use in small spaces.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..
It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.
Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.
I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?

If I went solely by some of these reviews I probably would not have tried this as I was fine with my Echo Dots... But much to my surprise, this thing is AWESOME!  It arrived in it's little box complete with the Spot, power cable (similar to the Kindle plugs) and quick guide.  As I already have an Amazon account and several Echos, the setup was relatively painless.  Once I got it online, and used the Alexa app on my tablet to get all the settings the way I wanted, this little thing started getting awesome.  I set my background screen, my Do Not Disturb times (that don't effect the alarms you set BTW) and night time display.  I played around with the Amazon Music, and while it doesn't compare to a full out Bluetooth speaker it still holds it's own and can fill our bedroom with sound.  The display, being rather small, is still quite clear and legible.  I can't see anything close without glasses but I have it set so I can easily read it.  The videos, again on the small side, were easily watchable.  So this Spot has replaced the alarm clock, bedroom radio, tablet and entertainer!  So, if you can use this as I found I could, please take all the negative reviews with a grain of salt and try this thing out.  You will be surprised!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can reduce the number, but no matter what each time the spot wakes up (like anytime someone passes in front of it) it will scroll at least one ""tip' or feature promoting it's own functionality.

I LOVE this little thing! I primarily bought it because I needed to replace my clock-radio with something that streamed music. I love that I can go to sleep listening to nature sounds, sleepy music, or even have a book read to me solely for the purpose of falling asleep!  The alarm has a nice gradually escalating sound -- not a jolting loud buzz or static from a radio station that isn't tuned in. If I wake during the night I can ask Echo what time it is without even having to open my eyes. When I have her play music she'll show the lyrics, and I can get the news or the weather while I'm getting dressed. The numbers on the clock are nice and large, but if I can't see the Spot I can just ask for the time. She will also display or tell me the next few things on my schedule. The sound quality is better than I expected. I like to loop the sound of rain so that it plays all night while I sleep, and sometimes I forget and I think it is really raining! She also turns the light off (with the help of a smart outlet), makes phone calls, and adds things to my shopping list that I remember as I'm drifting off to sleep! The Spot's shape and size is perfect for my nightstand too -- less then half the size of my old clock-radio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Raposo","A great little device, but needs some more options and tweaks...hopefully soon!","December 21, 2017","Just set this up last night and so far I am happy with it. It's not perfect yet...but I'm sure amazon will continue to tweak it to its best potential. Sound quality is MUCH better than an echo dot in my opinion, but not that of a regular echo. Still though I was very impressed with the sound quality for such a small device.

One thing I like is that it auto dims to a VERY dim state at night so you can easy check the time in complete darkness but it isn't super bright.
One thing I don't like is I wish I could change the BOLD-ness or size of the digital time at night. It's still really too small for the screen space and hard to read if you don't have it RIGHT next to you on a night stand (I keep mine on a bureau about 8 feet away). There is plenty of screen room to increase the size I am confident that this will come eventually....(I hope!) The only other option would be putting one on each nightstand of the room.

As far as the other features...all of the alexa features are there and they are, of course, awesome. SO many different things you can do. Pretty much everything you Echo Show....you can do with this.

To me, this device has a bright future for sure!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

McDonough","Very Nice Addition to the Echo Family!","December 21, 2017","I’ve had the opportunity to play with my Spot for just about 24-hours now, and I have to admit that I am pretty impressed so far! The display is very nice, the touch screen is responsive, the ambient light sensor does a great job of reducing brightness of the screen to adjust for lighting in the room, and the speakers are GREAT. (I really think that it sounds a ton better than the Echo Dots do!) I love being able to upload a personal photo to use as the “clock face” and the ability to schedule “night mode” is great. It’s just as nice as having the “always on display” on my phone, and it was dim enough during the night as not to bother me.

My BIGGEST complaint thus far is (what I consider to be) an EPIC failure on behalf of the Echo Spot’s development team. Why in the name of Pete would you NOT give users the ability to display a 24-hour time format??? ASIDE from the practical applications of the 24-hour format, there are HUNDREDS UPON THOUSANDS of military personnel, police, fire, ETC. that use the 24-hour time format as a way of life. I KNOW that it is probably more difficult than just being a “display issue” considering that timers, alarms, etc. are all based on vocal commands, but I somehow doubt that it’s beyond the realm of possibilities.

Aside from that, the only thing that I am a tad bit annoyed with are all the “Things to Try” messages that keep popping up on my screen. I’d like to be able to turn those off. This is a solid product and is HIGHLY recommended!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The drop in feature has been a blessing as I can place the Show in my mother’s room while I am in another room such as the kitchen cooking and can see and talk to her from my iPhone.

The set-up was very easy, especially since Amazon pre-configured the Spot to work with my Amazon account. What made it so smooth was that choosing wifi network and entering the password was done all on the Spot - no need to use the Alexa App. After setup there is a brief video showing you how to do certain things - like how to get to the settings screen by swiping down.

It has a capacitive touch screen, and is very responsive.

I keep my Echo Spot on my desk, so there was no need for the adjustable stand.

The user interface needs some work - it makes minimum use of the fact that the screen is round. For example, the volume slider is a straight line instead of being curved. Since this device has a screen, there ought to be on-screen buttons to snooze or stop alarms instead of saying ""Alexa, snooze"" or ""Alexa, stop"".

There are only six analog and six digital clock faces, and the digital ones don't have the option for showing 24-hour time (military time). Also, the font size for the digital clocks cannot be enlarged. There is the option of uploading a background image from the Alexa App, but you cannot adjust size or centering once it is uploaded.

The audio quality is much better than the Dot's, and is close to the full-sized Echo. In other words, the audio quality is GREAT!

I'm an Alexa developer, and can't wait to see what can be done with it once the SDK is updated. Overall, a very good device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have mine on my desk, where it replaced a Dot. Although the audio is much better than the Dot's, I'm running the sound through my computer's speakers, since I listen to a lot of music. Stand-alone, the speaker on a par with an average laptop speaker.

Video calling works well. The screen is big enough for a decent view of the person on the other end, and those talking to me reported that they could see everything clearly. The Show is a better choice for those who want to watch longer videos, but the Spot is fine for news clips and similar short-form video. Being able to watch in letterbox or in ""full screen"" are good options.

Also, worth noting: The device's angle is perfect for viewing while sitting at a desk.

I was originally using a Dot in my bedroom and decided to switch to the spot, and I am quite pleased. The speaker is substantially better than the Dot. I also find that it hears me better than the Dot. Since this is being used as an alarm clock, this is where the advantage over the Dot comes in to play. On the Dot, you can either search for the button to hush Alexa, or scream to Alexa to shut up because she doesn't hear well over the alarm.  The Echo Spot allows to you simply tap the screen anywhere for snooze. You can't miss.  You can also swipe up from the bottom to cancel the alarm. I also like ""Show me the alarms"" and I get a visual display on the screen of the pending alarms.  Play some music and the screen shows me the album art and lyrics of the song playing.  Ask Alexa ""Where's my stuff"" and I see photos of my items displayed as it reads me the status. The device feels very solid, well made.  I will say it didn't seem right to have to pay an additional $20 for the base that really should be in the box. The base definitely completes the package though and allows it to swivel.  I would suggest if you are looking at an Echo device for the bedroom, the Spot won't disappoint.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

EVERY device out there has the functionality to let you wake up to music except this one. All I want is Alexa to wake me up with a song and turn on my smartbulb automatically, and do so at different times for different days of the week, and somehow this device makes it impossible. Also, the Alexa app is super cumbersome, glitchy, and poorly designed in general. Amazon DEFINITELY needs to work on the alarm functionality.

Screen flicker, Google it. Amazon continues to sell this broken product. Buyer beware DO NOT BUY!!!
Also this surprise from AMAZON on Christmas!  I purchased two echo spots as christmas gifts for my nephews.  Yesterday 12/27 I get an email saying my Echo Spot has been activated on my account.  Amazon activated the devices on my account without my authorization!  I contacted support and they explained that I didn't select ""this item is a gift"" on check out which caused the problem.  So apparently if you do not select ""this item is a gift"" before check out then your device comes ready to be activated without needing any authorization password or email.  This is a real concern as what if a thief stole my package, activated the device and made purchases!  Honestly with all our digital information these large companies like Amazon, Fb, etc. have.  You would think they would treat your information with the responsibility it deserves.  I'm not going to give AMAZON products as gifts from now on and recommend the same for anyone thinking of purchasing an AMAZON device as a gift.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Added the Spot on release day. I am using it as a replacement for my Dot/Wave radio combination. So far I love it. The sound is surprisingly full and robust, a huge improvement from the Dot's speaker (which I never used, always connect my Dot devices to older Bose Wave & Acoustomas radios to give them new life) The Spot has taken up residence on my nightstand and has been working much better than I had hoped. Use it to stream music, SXM and podcasts. The alarm has worked well, allowing us to wake up to the included alarm sounds or any media we chose. I has originally planned to pair the Show with a Bose Sound Link Mini, fearing I would need a more robust sound but that has not been necessary.

It is easy to set up and use. It has the ability to play very softly or very loudly. I was impressed with how loud the volume goes.

Pros:
*Volume can be controlled manually or verbally
*Contains a huge selection of songs and gives you the option to listen to a sample and then purchase songs that aren't included
*Voice recognition works pretty well
*Can play amazon prime videos. The screen is small but the volume is good
*Has a ""find my phone"" feature
*Can pause, stop, or skip a song manually or with voice
*Has a subtitle feature so the words scroll down the screen

Cons:
*Echo responds any time Alexa is called. So, if I'm listening to a song and my child say's ""Alexa"" my song is interrupted and potentially overrided. A simple conversation about proper use with kids fixes this problem.
*Every time Alexa asks if we want to purchase a song we say 'no.' I'm not sure how easy it is to make accidental purchases.

Overall, I am very happy with the Echo Spot. It's a really nice way to listen to music quickly and its easy enough to use even kids can do it. I enjoy writing quality reviews.

I have been on the phone and on chat for hours now, two weeks of it. My spot when I use it as an alarm clock and have placed an alarm series in, weekdays, 6:30 a.m., Monday-Friday, when I go to physically dismiss the alarm by swiping up at dismiss on the face or when I ask Alexa to shut alarm, it does shut it but then proceeds to delete the alarm series, every single time since I let it go live. Customer service after 8 attempts finally told me last night that the verbal command does not work and will delete the alarms, it is being worked on by the developer, (the all powerful developer it seems?)? They told me to just use the UI or the swipe gesture. When I told them again for the 17th time that the swipe gesture for me did not work and deleted the series of alarms after it shut alarms, they said it was being worked on by the developer. When I said I have been told this 27 times and nobody is getting back to me and I purchased this mainly to use as a smart alarm clock and the verbal command and the physical UI swipe both should work and not delete the alarm series, again I am back to square one. Waiting for a week for them to get back to me now, if not will pack up and ship it back. Sad for $150 with the stand not to be able to use the spot as an alarm. Who would want to set it every night.

No battery for power failures, so I still have to use my cellphone alarm as a backup. No additional clock functions either - where's a timer or a stopwatch? Alexa already does these audibly - show them! Excellent selection of clock faces so far though, and the screen adds just the right touch to make it feel like a worthy successor to Dot.

Now, if Amazon would get their sh&t together and allow streaming of music from a LAN server, we'd hit 5 stars.

However, I find it a bit disappointing and underwhelming.

For having a nice, clear, lovely little touchscreen, you'd think it would have SO much more functionality of things you'd love it to be able to do.  It does not. At ALL.  While there are many clock faces to choose from, you can't really set it to display the info you want, how you want it.  For me, it seems like it should be simple and obvious that I should be able to have a full date and time display showing and in whatever format I like.  M/D/Y or Month, Day, Year, or whatever I want.  It has no option for ANY of this.

Next, theres no calendar display.  Like *actual* calendar display.  This seems like an obvious thing to have on a touchscreen clock, but it's not there.  There is a list of upcoming events which scrolls one day at a time, which is fine, but there's no way to just see where you are in the week or month at a glance.

What I am forcibly treated to instead are things I don't want.  Why does the clock scroll through all it's screens when I hear me walk into the room?  I have the scrolling turned off, and I don't want this, and yet here we are.  I want the *time* to be what's displayed when I walk in.  Why do I have to wait for it to scroll through all the things I didn't ask for to see that.  I'm also treated continually to the ""Things to try"" screen, which I don't want and am not allowed to turn off.  Why?

So in the end, Google is gonna make their own version of this, and irs probably gonna be a lot better in terms of providing the customizableness and functions you really want, and doing it right.  I WANT to like this sleek little clock more, it IS a sexy little orb which seems like it could have so much better potential... I DO like it as a simple desktop clock.  I just wish I hadn't spent $100+ for something that doesn't really live up to the ideal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Schaumburger","Simply Phenomenal","November 25, 2018","Wow! The Amazon Echo Spot is fantastic. It replaced my alarm clock, radio, and first generation Amazon Alexa. The screen is small, but very useful and easy to read. The speaker is strong and plenty loud enough for my bedroom. My Device came bundled with an electric switch, so it can control my night stand light. I’m very impressed with the quality of the Spot and the almost limitless things it can do. I have not used the built in camera, but that may come in handy in the future.

Baucom","Nice alarm clock with a useless camera.","May 21, 2018","I own the Alexa, Dot and the Spot. I was excited to receive this as a gift. Of the 3 Echo's I have the Spot is my least favorite.

First off, it has a built in camera. Why can't I access the camera via my Alexa App? I assume to be forced to buy the more expensive camera's. It's basically useless, for me at least. And $20 for the plastic stand? Really?
I have photo's uploaded to my Amazon account. The photos don't look that great in the background of the screen. Also they don't rotate much at all.
Streaming video on the device is useless. Very limited in what you can actually do with the screen. Basically it's an alarm clock with limited styles to choose from for the clock font. It's not like can use it with iPhone Facetime which I kinda hoped for.

I was hoping this thing would blow me away but I'm very disappointed. Amazon also has decided to remove storage space from it's loyal prime members and start charging like $7.99 a month for it. Not happy about that either.

I was really hoping this thing would rock and have all kinds of uses with the screen. I basically put it in my room. Don't use it except for the clock. maybe they'll update the software to do some better things. But for now it's just an expensive alarm clock. My Echo does rule the house still! And the Dot is on my back porch and makes for nice background music. The Spot is being neglected. Grounded until it can finally do something worth while. And the support isn't all that good too. If I'm missing something cool please let me know. I would love to love my Spot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have had it for a few months now so I feel like I can now give a solid review.

I am a mom so I love being able to ask for my ‘to-do’ list and SEE it so I can either add to it or check stuff off at night...and in the morning.  We also have Nest cameras and a ring doorbell so I can see all from my bedside.  I can ask for reminders or alarms to be set without having to move from bed (Moms understand this struggle).  Want to set the mood for sexy time?!?! Alexa can do that!  On this topic...you can block this device from the drop in feature!

I love that it senses when to go into night mode (aka just shows time and stays dark for good sleep).

By far my favorite thing has been pairing it with a smart plug for the lights in our bedroom!!!! Our bed is super high and far from our lights so it was always a pain to be reading errrr doing stuff before bed and have to get up to turn off lights ;)!

My only negative, which really isn’t a fault I thing they would be able to anything about is it has a hard time hearing me say the wake word when our noise machine is on.  Again I understand it’s more of my fault for using them together but since noise machines are common I figured I would mention it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The main use of the screen has been for clock faces, and I have different photos in the background, and it is easy to see without being glaring at night.

I have a few around the house and have replaced my older Echo Show - White with these. It turns out that no one at home ever wanted to watch videos on the Echo Show so having a large screen taking up counter space didn't make any sense. The Echo Spot is a perfect size for my kitchen counter and bedroom nightstand. Amazon recently fixed a serious Bluetooth bug where the Echo Spot would stop responding to the wake word if it was paired with a TROND TV Bluetooth Transmitter and Receiver, Digital Optical TOSLINK and 3.5mm Wireless Audio Adapter (AptX Low Latency for both TX and RX, Pair with 2 Devices Simultaneously) (kudos to Amazon Echo firmware engineers!) and now these are rock solid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Spot then didn't appeal as a clock. The Show is on the kitchen table for phone/TV replacement, etc. Dot is in laundry room because it has the lowest quality sound.

It loses one star because you cant turn off the ""Things to Try"" suggestions. I dont know if this was done to prevent ""burn-in"" on the screen, but all i want to do is maintain the time and weather on the screen. I dont need a constant suggestion of commands i should try.

There are three major issues we've run into.  I called Amazon support to see if there were ways around any of these and they confirmed all three were ""known limitations"" of the device.

1.  EXTREMELY limited Bluetooth support.  The speakers built into the Echo Spot aren't that great so we planned to connect to our Vizio soundbar via Bluetooth but I couldn't get the Spot to see the soundbar even though my phone and tablet could easily pair with it.  I then tried pairing it with a portable Bluetooth speaker and no luck there either.  Amazon support said that they only support a limited number of speakers.  I asked the agent how many speakers they support and she said it was about a dozen.  That's completely ridiculous!  The whole point of a standard like Bluetooth or USB is to support interoperability.  I'm not going to throw out a $300 soundbar because Amazon doesn't support that particular brand/model.

2.  You'll see this in a number of reviews and forum posts - there's no way to turn off the Alexa advertisements on the device.  You will constantly see ""Try asking Alexa to suggest a Prime movie"" and other similar content.  Amazon has built in settings that allow you to turn on or off everything EXCEPT these messages.  There's no way to shut them off.  The direct quote from my Amazon support assistant was ""At this time there is no way to turn off Alexa advertisements"".

3.  The camera quality is horrible.  We tried using our two devices as intercoms and the audio is just fine but the video is terrible.  All we could see was a silhouette of the other person.  If we cranked the brightness up to 100% then we could start to see the other person a bit but the quality was absolutely terrible.  I would have suspected a defective camera but we had the same quality issues in both devices.

Overall we're extremely disappointed.  They definitely are not as advertised.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wish I had not purchased the two clunkier Shows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_137?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=137&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love having a clock and the weather displayed in my bedroom, but there is a huge problem with this device. In the stack of cards that you can display (clock, weather, notifications, reminders, etc.), there is a ""Things to Try"" tips card. You cannot turn this off.

With this, you're essentially left with two choices: 1. set your cards to rotate once (and see Things to Try once) and then not be able to rotate to the weather or anything else, or 2. put up with seeing a ""Things to Try"" tip about a third of the time you look at your clock and never see the weather.

For a $130 device, this NEEDS to be fixed. I do NOT want to see these tips. You can turn on and off any other card but this, and that totally ruins it. I'm considering sending it back and just using a dot instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You can even tell it to play anything that is on Prime video , although the screen is a bit small when it cuts the top and bottom to make 4:3 or 16:9 mode, it is still a crystal clear screen and is sometimes nice to have something playing on my desk when I am doing work in the office. He speaker volume is great for its size. I can control my hue lights with my voice and multiple other WiFi outlets.

I discovered by accident that I can play any of my prime video on the spot as well (very small picture though).  We haven't tried to do video chats yet.

We have an original Echo, a dot, a spot, fireTV stick, and at my mother's a dot, spot, and a fireTV stick and a FireTV.  Between the two houses we also have 4 of the Echo buttons to play games.

The main selling point with this is the AI, Alexa, which you can easily program and add countless libraries to from a web page. The rub here, is that you have to give all your passwords to Amazon, be they Spotify, Arlo, Samsung, etc. Another kinda cool feature is a 'drop in' button, which displays your mug from your cell phone, after downloading the App, so you can video conference a la Skype. Voice detection works about 80% of the time. The other 20%, Alexa can't hear you over what it's playing, to turn it down or off. Despite having a fun design that has more personality than most Alexa devices, it's showing its age, even with discount pricing. So, if you really need a touch and sound sensitive clock radio, go for it.

I purchased the spot version of the echo primarily to go with our new Ring doorbell as I wanted something handy to see who is at the door without finding and fumbling with my smartphone  to open the ring app (and my husband still uses a flip phone, which doesn't do the ring app). Spot displays the door much quicker that the process on my phone. We CAN both hear and speak to visitors at the door with the ring app on the spot. (I've seen info on line stating that you can only hear visitors but they can't hear you with the spot. )
I also purchased the matching stand to go with the spot. The stand makes it sit up higher and it's easier to adjust the position of the spot. The price seems high for what it is, though. Nevertheless, I'm glad I got it.
Setup was easy, but this was my second echo. Note that you can scroll down on the Spot's  screen. I was stuck on a step of the first set up page I encountered that required scrolling down to see the arrow to click to go on to the next step.
I had to call customer support to complete wireless connection with my first echo but not this one. With a little Google help I paired the echo with the Ring doorbell.
The spot does function by default as a clock and also displays local outside temperature,  but these displays are constantly interspersed with other messages: trending topics and suggestions for using Alexa. I tapped screen to open trending topic and a short article opened. I tried tapping screen to go back to default display but nothing happened.  The display did return to default momentarily as if there is a preset time for the article to display the article before it returns to the usual routine. The default display does NOT include the date. I realize I can ask Alexa the date but would still like for this to be on the screen as I am a visual person who  needs to ascertain the date several times a day. Seeing the date visually helps it stick with me more than hearing it verbally.
There are an array of clockface styles for you to choose from.
Our experience with having Alexa available in several rooms  for asking a question or making a request has been delightful. Before Alexa, I was  always  thinking about looking up something or setting a reminder on my smartphone later, when I  had time. Now I can multitask by immediately asking Alexa to respond/perform a task. I can continue changing over the laundry while asking Alexa to set a reminder for one hour or asking what the weather is going to be like this afternoon or make that phone call that keeps slipping my mind. We can immediately get an answer to all of the things we usually just  ""wonder"" about in discussion (I wonder how old  Clint Eastwood is? I wonder when the superbowl is?). We can just include Alexa in the conversation to get the answer rather than breaking off conversation to Google it (keyboard or verbally) on a handheld device.
I'm excited to involve Alexa in even more management and fun, informative skills over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I did the usual reading-up and decided to go with Google Home.  This year I thought I'd give Alexa a try because I thought some of the things people didn't like last year might be worked out by now (not as many apps associated, things ""she"" could do, knowledge base, etc.).  Using them side-by-side, I gotta say  that Alexa still has a way to go to catch up to Google.  The sound quality on Google Home is better - my cheap one sounds like a Bose compared to the old transistor radio sound of Alexa.  And Google finds answers to most questions that leave Alexa scratching her head.  I'll keep it and use it - the video option is kind of fun.

The setup is fairly simple as long as you follow the instructions and tie it to the correct Amazon account. What was fun about the spot was having it work with Skype. Setting up to work was annoying. There weren't any good articles online on how to set it up, and I felt I was going in circles.

Fortunately, we figured it out. First you'll need the Amazon Alexa app on your smart phone, and then making sure to allow contacts through ""Communicate"" and link to Skype.

But there is a work around.","January 17, 2018","As I am sure many have or plan to, I bought this to use as a pretty cool alarm clock. Well there's a huge issue with that and Amazon, seems not to be too concerned about fixing it. So these devices have separate volume slides for timers, alarms, notifications from the main volume. I have mine set as high as it can go. But then I want to go to sleep listening to some music.  Obviously I set the main volume music to play at a low volume, so I can fall asleep. I then set the alarm to wake me up at 7:00 am. So what happens. I fall asleep with the music playing at volume 2, and then I wake up around 7:45 am. I notice the alarm on this device is going off.. But it's at an even lower volume than I had set the music for the night before. I'm like WTF! I was glad I wasn't relying on this alarm to wake me up to catch a morning flight, which is sometimes the case. I can several tests that morning. What I discovered is, if you have music playing, any timer or alarm which is set to go off will go off at a lower volume than the playing music and will totally disregard the volume setting of the slider bar specifically for alarms, timers and notifications. I sent a feedback notifying Amazon of this issue and except for a short ""We will look into this"" they have done nothing for the past couple of weeks. Well this device is totally useless as a bedside alarm and I'll go back to using an alarm I can trust. I gave Amazon time to fix this, but I'm not holding on to it past the return period. So this thing is going back to Amazon until they can figure out how to make it a functional alarm clock.

Update: 1/17/18: So after numerous tests I did find a work around to my main issue. To get the alarm to function properly, you have to use one of the Sleep Timer commands for your music the night before. It works, but I still think the 2 volume settings should function independently. I'm still not very impressed with the device for the cost though. Some more new clock faces and more useful features could change that. The clock face selection is very limited.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_431?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=431&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes I mainly use it for an alarm clock but the reason I love it is because I was constantly having problems with a $15 AM/FM radio alarm clock making changes and hitting the wrong buttons or not pressing the buttons in the right sequence.  Hold this button down while pushing this other button to change whatever.  I would constantly have to find the manual online to fix any accidental changes I made to either the alarm time or radio station presets.

I wanted something where I didn't have to push buttons to make changes and this fits the bill perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But here is the worse: Terribel unreliable alarm
When I set the alarm to ""Every weekday, at 6AM, play Pandora"" - it works for a few days and then the music duration starts to get shorter and shorter (the time the music alarm stays on before you say ""Alexa Stop"") and eventually (in around a week) there is no more alarm.

I wouldn’t pick it to anchor my smart home, but as a second echo that doubles as an alarm clock it’s awesome! I have disabled the camera so I won’t speak to any camera related functions.

Pros:
Alexa is awesome!
Sounds good relative to it’s size.
The screen/clock are easy on the eyes at night.
The alarm options are very pleasant and configurable.
I like the weather and news functions that it provides.
It’s a breeze to set up.

Cons:
Price.
Camera feels invasive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_92?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=92&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Quinn","Good voice assistant overall but lacks polish","January 22, 2018","Overall: Good voice-assistant device with the expected basic functionality (smart home, calendar, lists, music, etc.) but still rough around the edges.

Pros: Great voice recognition, can hear and usually understand you from across the room even with music playing. Has all the main features you'd expect from a voice assistant. Connects and manages most smart home devices quite well. Ordering is easier compared to other Echo products with on-screen feedback in addition to the audio.

Cons: Internal speaker is hollow and tinny sounding, fine for voice but not good for music or radio and you can connect to SONOS but you can only play music through SONOS, and not override the default speaker. Cannot get rid of ""Things to Try"" flashing on the home screen, which feels like it's advertising itself constantly. Not integrated with iMessage and Amazon's message system is a little clunky.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hoov","Great clock...except for the background choices.","January 6, 2018","How about a basic grey or black background and or the ability to adjust font size when uploading a personal photo. I prefer the digital clock but the backgrounds are limited with no plain colors. I created a plain background photo and uploaded it to the device. However when you do that the clock moves to the bottom of the screen and reduces in size to the point that it is harder to see. I guess they think that if you want to upload a personal picture the font should be smaller and at the bottom in order to see the picture, but surely it isn’t that hard to provide a plain color background.

Functionally the device works great, but sometimes it is the simplest of things that cause a product to be less than perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_395?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=395&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Strangely enough, though, it's a miserable, terrible clock.  My cheap old clock radio has bright 7/8"" (digital) numbers.  I can see it day or night from anywhere in the room.  The echo spot has half-size digits, 7/16"" but only when it feels like showing them.  It goes to sleep at night, so if you're half asleep you're out of luck.  You can wake yourself up, and move close  enough to see the tiny dimmed numbers, or you could call out and ask it, and wake everyone else, or you can just go back to sleep and quit worrying about the time.  And as often as not, it changes those tiny 7/16"" digits to much smaller ones to show you the temperature.  I know I could go into settings and make that stop but my old clock radio never sacrificed the time to make me look at the temperature.  To add insult to injury, they advertise the echo spot as having all these different clock faces.  What a lousy scam!  You have these tiny digital numbers, and you can change them to 5 other tiny digital numbers that are exactly the same.  The screen is large enough that they could make it a fine clock, I don't understand why they don't?

On the plus side it does do all the alexa stuff and plays music, and it's even easier to set up because it has a screen so you can choose a wifi network and type in a password without using another device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wirth","Spot takes Alexa and Echo to a whole new level--you need at least one!","January 1, 2018","I received mine yesterday and the unboxing was about as exciting as it gets. Beautiful packaging and the gorgeous Spot unit felt substantial in my eager hands. Its design and workmanship are truly first rate--especially at this price. It does all the usual Echo stuff but the beautiful touch screen takes it to another level altogether. You can also swipe through several screens where there are other views and options available such as a screen showing what is music playing complete with touch volume and track controls. The result is that you can do a lot less yelling at Alexa to do things for you or fooling around with the cranky Alexa app. It replaced a misbehaving Dot Gen 1 and an old clock radio, and it looks beautiful in the bedroom. Setup is done from the touch screen so you can say CYA to the Alexa app. I use it primarily for music and have it hooked up to two rescued/reborn mini Jambox speakers paired in stereo mode. Thanks to Amazon Music with its advanced fidelity technology (it replaces your uploads with high fidelity tracks) it sounds fantastic at the low volumes required for adult bedroom use. I tried the built-in speaker for a few minutes and it sounds much better than the Dot and closer to the Echo 2, albeit with lower volume potential. In fact, it sounds good enough all on its own and just may be sufficient for quiet spots like a bedroom, but external speakers really seal the deal. Finally, the Spot with touch screen and camera does a whole lot of new stuff that I probably will not use and note that I turned off the camera because it is creepy in a bedroom setting (it is easily turned back on using the settings touch screen should you want to use it for video calls, etc.) In summary, I could not be happier with this supremely-designed and constructed unit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One thing that definitely impressed me is its dimming ability. W/ many smart displays, if they dim at all, they can't go nearly dim enough to avoid disturbing my sleep w/ the amount of light they produce. The Spot absolutely excels at this. It's literally the best smart alarm clock I've ever owned, plus you have all the add'l capabilities of the screen and the Echo functionality.

Dinged it one star because the audio quality could be just a touch better, and the adjustable stand should be included w/ a device that costs $130. Adding $20 for the plastic stand is just a touch insulting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_82?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=82&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Previous to this, I was going to send it back.
It arrived 2 days before it was supposed to, so I couldn't click on ""RETURN ITEM"".
Called Customer Service, which was a pain, having to look up on Google. . .

The short answer:  Do it FROM THE DEVICE, not from your phone.
Say  ""Alexa, Go TO Settings""  Which seems to take 2 or 3 tries.  Choose ""HOME AND CLOCK""  ""HOMECARDS""  Pick ROTATE ONCE and select the things YOU would like, like the Weather.

I have an Android, and as of today you can NOT change the settings to fix this.  It's only on the device.
I complained to customer service, they were not even aware of the Android issue.  Probably works from iPhone??

Anyway, hope this helps.

The Echo Spot worked perfectly. Now I can drop in and check on him when I am not at home or at work. He also uses it to listen to his audiobooks and to read the Bible each day. Thanks Amazon for a great tool to help me, help him.

So, I bought this for my primary alarm clock, thinking it would be awesome as a full time college student, to be able to set routines that wake me up automatically/turn on the lamp/start flash briefing to help me wake up at different times of the week, given that I wake up at different times on Monday, Wednesday, Friday than I do on Tuesday’s and Thursday’s. So I go to set it up and they say that amazon won’t set up routines or groups with the Show or Spot. Why not? Why severely limit your product like that?? It makes no sense. Please change this as it’s totally nonsensical not to allow them to utilize what i think is the most crucial feature of the Alexa Line.

Most every night-time device is too bright. The Echo Spot is the dimmest I've seen, and I can read the clock easily without glasses. Those that aren't buying this, because they know that it will be too bright, they are likely wrong!

You can dim on a day/night schedule, and it dims on its own with light sensors on top.

They made the hour hand thick in the clockface I use. All you want to know in the middle of the night, is what hour it is, so thats easy too.

Great sound and a suprisingly convenient display of timers, lyrics, weather, and more!","January 22, 2018","We are a family of echos (we have 10 in our house).  The new Echo spot is great.  The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small device and the convenience of the screen is really nice.  We're still deciding if we should keep this in the kitchen or get the Echo Show and move this to a bedroom.

The touch screen is great for quickly pausing, skipping or reviewing song (on Pandora).  It also displays your personal photo, the weather, timers and the lyrics to songs.

Another cool feature is that you can see your Arlo cameras, just by asking Alexa to ""show me the backyard camera.""  It's a great feature among many others.  Being able to visually see the remaining time on your timers is great for the kitchen (or maybe for a timeout clock for the little ones)!

I think this one will ultimately end up on a night stand for us, so that we have an excuse to get the bigger screen of an Echo Show, but it's really a nice device.

I also have the Echo Plus, which does have a better speaker than the Spot, but for the price and the fact it has video I think the Spot is a much better deal. So between the 3 I would choose the Spot hands down - in fact I plan to get 2 more for other rooms.

The ""drop-in"" feature is very cool and makes a great room to room video intercom (you can also drop in from a mobile phone anywhere for video calling), although I don't know how often we'd really use it.  We'll see once we have a couple in the house.  But what I really like it for is the ability to view video cameras in the house.

I have the EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus, which is a great camera for the nursery, and I can ask the Spot to show the camera on screen and watch it.  I'm sure there are plenty of other cameras with Alexa support that would work just as well with the Spot, just make sure you research it to make sure it has a supported skill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He is snoozing to something by London Philharmonic at the moment. He might know that his photo is on the face of Spot. I like her so much that I bought Show for the kitchen (not set up yet). We have a sassy Echo that speaks when not spoken to and a Dot that ignores me a bit too often - she may get the boot if she doesn't shape up.

I downloaded the application from Alexa and Amazon Music in the USA. I brought it to Brazil and it works perfectly. However, I do not advise buying and trying to install Alexa and Amazon Music in Brazil because you will not be able to. These app are not available neither in the brazilians’ apple store nor in google play . But I think they will soon be. I use Echo Spot to listen to music, turn on the timer, wake up, and even make video calls. But you have to speak English with Alexa.

Also when editing alarms it would be nice to have a greater range of customization and not just a setting for individual days or full week days or weekends.  so when you enter the selection for what day you want the alarm  where it would say every monday or every week you get to select more then one, for instance every monday every tuesday every wednesday then you select done so now you have that one alarm set at the same time for those three days and not the entire week.

Well, Alexa plays music for me and reads my audible books and gets my grocery list together, helps me find a recipe for dinner....
I say ‘Good Morning Alexa,’ and she is set up to give me the weather, the traffics and the news headlines!
You May chuckle at this step into the ‘new age of technology,’ for an old chick like me, I immediately bought another for downstairs!

I know there are a lot more things I can do with it, but I’m a work-in-progress.  I don’t have any Smart devices & I only have one Echo, so I know I’m using it well below it’s capabilities.  The fact that it’s a touchscreen is really nice and the clock face makes it a great bedside or kitchen clock.

To be honest, it has, more or less, become a fancy, modern, 21 century alarm clock, that answers questions, more or less, more often than not. I do love the sound, the sound of music because of its speaker system, considering I still use an external bluetooth speaker, every now and then. The screen is too tiny for me, if I wanted to see something in the middle of the night, I would have to find my glasses and that is no easy feat. And I do hate the fact that it does not broadcast YouTube, which I spend many hours watching, usually in regard to camping. As I was reading some questions and answers, someone mentioned that it has no snooze. But, I just read...that you can just ask Alexa to ""snooze the alarm""...learned something new today. I have to try it tomorrow morning. I just usually just say stop and then wake up 30 minutes later.

These devices (dot and Spot) are an absolute godsend. Anything I want to be reminded of can merely be spoken to the device (while I'm still seated on the couch ) such as ""Alexa, remind to call my daughter today at 3:00 p.m.""  At 3:00 p.mp. sharp the dot or Spot (I got both) gives a gentle chime and says ""Steven, you asked me to remind you to call your daughter today at 3:00""  Similar reminders can be set for virtually anything.  If you want a shopping list you simply say ""Alexa, create a shopping list (you can name the list to be store specific) and Alexa will add anything you want.  If you remember something else to add (5 minutes or five days later) you simply say ""Alexa, add socks to my Target list."" and Alexa will add it (it gives polite verbal confirmation of everything you add.  At anytime you can ask what is on a specific list and Alexa will  verbally run down your entire list.  you can add, delete, change with just verbal command. If you use the Smartphone App your list will appear on your phone for reference when you get to the store.  Plays music, calculates math, finds recipes, etc. all by just asking the question.

I'm quite familiar with Alexa and Echo devices as a whole, but this is my first experience with one that has a screen on it. I'd like I see the documentation specific to this device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_125?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=125&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is a reliable alarm clock","January 17, 2018","We have three Echo Spots and we think that they are fantastic!  It is a reliable alarm clock, a video intercom, a source of pop and classical music, a voice-control for certain household lights, a weather station, a timer, a place to keep notes, etc.  Its ability to respond to voice commands is remarkable; it needed no training to recognize my California ""accent"" and my wife's Alabama speech.  It worked immediately out of the box -- so long as you have a home WiFi setup.
We can set a particular time for weekday alarms (or individual days) and another for either (or both) of the weekend mornings.  A lot of the digital alarm clocks on the market now are too high-pitched for my hearing and so it is great that we can choose among a large number of different kinds of sounds for the alarm.
When I was confined to bed recently, my wife and I used Echo Spots as an intercom system between my location and my wife at the home office which is at some distance away; and we could see each other while talking.
This device deserves five stars and more.  Sure, it doesn't do the washing and ironing, but it does many jobs and it does them well at a reasonable price.  I have no reservations in recommending the Echo Spot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_178?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=178&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love the Shopping List feature, quick answer to any question & the ability to play whatever music, whenever. Also use it as an intercom to talk to hubby in his remote office.
I wanted to replace my always ""too bright"" alarm clock with one that would reset automatically & wasn't glaringly bright (even in low mode). So I picked up Spot on a Black Friday Deal & really like it.  I love that I can set the alarm by voice, no more struggling with buttons in the dark. The digital numbers are large enough to see without my glasses but not too bright at all. They adjust depending on the light in the room.  I now can wake to whatever song I feel like instead of the scratchy FM music.  I use it as a speaker when I'm upstairs cleaning or doing laundry too. May seem like alot of money for an alarm clock, but I really like it.
In reading some other reviews I have noted some people say they don't want all the ""things to try"" displayed just the time & weather. I found out how to set mine to this. I actually just set it to the time. No annoying ads or anything else. So it IS do-able. I put one of my favorite family photos on it as the background as well. The screen IS really too small for watching TV as the ad seems to imply. Unless you are 21 with great eye sight.
It's a great alarm clock, looks good on my night stand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

After a couple weeks with it I love the clock feature but that's about all the little screen is good for. Amazon needs to come up with something else that works well for a small screen to make this thing worth the money.

Sound quality is nothing special. Mine is hooked up to an external speaker like the dot was before but I did notice that the sound before hooking up to the speaker was better than the dot but nowhere near my echo. The sound quality doesn't justify the price.

Camera? Not sure why it has one other than adjusting the brightness on its best feature, the clock. I was hoping to be able to do a video drop in to the babies room or recordable motion sensor security camera functionality or anything useful but no such functionality is available yet.

Overall it is a good looking addition to the echo family but I don't think it is near worth the price tag. I feel like I just spent $130 on a nice looking bedside clock with little unique functionality over the dot it replaced.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love these devices and use them to listen to music and control various connected devices in our home like lights, plugs, doorbells and Nest products. The Spot seemed like a natural to replace the Echo Dot and old school alarm clock on my nightstand. I really like how the face gets sufficiently dark at night so it does not distract you from sleeping. One glaring mistake that I cannot see how they missed is the volume buttons are totally flush with the surface. It is almost impossible to feel them in the dark which is basic alarm clock design. It's also a little pricey but I'm sure over time it will come down. A few other things. The receptacle in the back for the power looks exactly like the audio out and neither is labeled. It is also a proprietary type and not universal like USB.

Amazon support just told me that to make an update possible they need enough people to request the change. First change needed: Make brief mode available.  Brief Mode (where Alexa does less talking back) is not an option on the Spot as of now. Second change needed: completely turn off Alexa suggestions.  212 replies concerning this, people suggest you can by going to settings and changing to rotate once. I did it. Alexa will still then suggest things after your voice commands. It may not be rotating but this is still very annoying. Should be an option. I would like to have my clock available in what ever color I want, as well as more than two locations when I have my personal photo as a screen.  Time is in way of faces in photo.  These things I can't imagine why they can't make available as options.

Video Streaming:
The Spot allows you to stream your Amazon video content. You can choose from 3 screen aspect ratios. Full screen will crop out a lot of the picture.

Calling/Messaging:
Simple to set up calling/messaging. Video calling works well but you do need to be in a well lit room or the picture will be grainy

Positives:  The sound is good.  The form factor and build are great.  It just works with all my home devices.  Fits in well with all the other echo devices in my house (love the drop-in feature).

Negatives:  I want to be able to use it on my desk in my home office to keep track of my calendar and use as a personal assistant; however, the ridiculously annoying ""things to try"" home card makes my OCD skin crawl.  I'm forced to set the home card to rotate once, which saves my sanity, but turns it into a clock with an echo dot.  The calendar syncs well with my Google calendar, but the displayed information is way too generic.  Why do I care that I have ""8 upcoming events"".  How does that help?

Please, for the love of all that is holy and good, add the option to turn off the ""things to try"" card!

Storandt","Perfect!","March 19, 2018","The spot is exactly what I wanted. No you cannot jam music loudly because the speaker wasn’t made for that unlike the other devices that use music and sound as a selling point (which is why I bought the echo plus and hub) but it’s loud enough. I needed a louder alarm clock because of my fear of over sleeping when switching my shift to early mornings from nights. Not to mention I can wake to amazon prime stations like Pink Floyd so you don’t wake to the same sound or song over and over again (a plus since the mind eventually tunes it out over time). The small screen works just as well, very crisp picture. No regrets on purchasing the spot. I bought my teenage kids one too for their rooms when they took a liking to mine. My son tends to not set his alarms so I can check his settings and turn his alarms on from the app which has saved us from him over sleeping which he use to do a lot and got into trouble at school, the teachers love that he has this now. No complaints here 😊","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:

+ The sound quality is much better than I expected for such a small speaker. It is more than adequate for a bedside of office room speaker.
+ The loudness of the alarms can be preset. I often go to bed listening to the BBC World Service and wake up to a station that has a lower volume. I like that I can set the volume of the morning station to compensate for the difference.
+ The night mode makes the screen dim enough not to disturb my sleep.
+ The touch screen and buttons give you some operability, if you don't want speak to Alexa.

Cons:

+ Setting up a reoccurring alarm is klunky. I have to ask Alexa to set an alarm and then go into the (iOS) app to make it go off each weekday BUT I can't  set an alarm (reoccurring or not) using the app alone. Additionally I can't ask Alexa to set an alarm more than 24 hours in the future. I have to ask the Alexa to set up a current alarm and then go into the app and tweak it to make it go off more than 24 hours in the future. But I can't set up any new alarms in the app by itself.
+ The app struggles remembering Favourites in TuneIn. More than once it's dropped a Favourite and then when I ask Alexa to play it, it will search and bring up the wrong station.
+ Alexa struggles with bringing up correct non-US stations. For example, if I ask it to play ""CBC Radio One Montréal on TuneIn"" I'll get the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Barbados. However, if I ask for Alexa to play ""Radio One Montréal on TuneIn"" she will tell me she's about to play ""CBC Radio One Montréal on TuneIn"". Sometimes she understands call letters, sometimes frequencies, but in other cases they won't work. It's very quirky.
+ The Echo Spot (and I presume all Echo products) can't be configured to log into a WiFi spot that prompts for a usename and password (unless it is on a webpage.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There are some things I enjoy about it; the small form factor, Bluetooth capabilities, and Alexa integration, but there are a few things I wish they could've done better, primarily the speaker.  While it's great that I can connect to a Bluetooth speaker, there are a few issues I've encountered, like the maximum volume staying low unless I adjust the volume from the device, then it gets much louder.  Probably just some software bugs, but it's a minor inconvenience nonetheless.  It could be a little more powerful, especially the bass, but I'm not using it as my primary speaker; I use Bluetooth and connect to my TV's sound bar.

All in all, it's an effective smart speaker with a built-in screen.  Most things I can positively say about the Echo Spot apply to the entire family of Echo products, like the ability to use multi-room music, phone calls, and schedule integration.

I would recommend this if you're looking for a replacement alarm clock with Alexa support built in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_47?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=47&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unless I'm missing something there's really no way to play music from the speakers for free--good music anyway. I thought I could just say ""Hey Alexa, play some calm music"" like my friend's google speaker could do. Unfortunately you can no longer upload your own music to your Amazon account so I can't even play music off my iPhone. The only way to play music off my phone is via bluetooth which is not as streamlined as just saying, ""Hey Alexa, play *song name here*"" from my phone. I have to turn on bluetooth and connect from my phone then search for the song or try to navigate via Siri. The way they try to force you to pay extra for Amazon music, take away the ability to upload your own music, and the lack of other free options really cripples the main reason people buy Echo devices or their equivalent (according to surveys playing music is the #1 use for these things).

Being able to make calls with the camera was the other reason I bought these but the quality is really bad and it's hard to position it right even with the (overpriced) $20 base. Overall not super impressed. Would rather just pull up FaceTime or Facebook Messenger/Whatsapp and call from my phone.

The touch screen is nice, the brightness is fine, and the speakers are okay--but overall. I feel this is just one pricey alarm clock. Maybe when they figure out how to get YouTube back on or a better free music service this will be of better use.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was finally pushed over the edge to buy something when my new cable boxes arrived and the clock no longer displayed (and I was too lazy to read the instructions to find out if there was a way to activate a display). Anywho... Since I had an immediate need for a clock, I decided to give the Spot a try. I absolutely love it!
PROS: It's so darn cute!  It's an unobtrusive addition to my nightstand. I love being able to ask Alexa all manner of questions and get a response. Because I'm new to Amazon's assistant, I'm sure there's a lot of functionality I haven't figured out, but for now it fits the bill.

CONS: As many have mentioned, the camera kinda freaked me out. I have disabled it, but who knows if a hacker can override that?!?! Also, I use this as an alarm clock. I don't like the fact that I have to set one alarm at the time. It would be nice to set my weekend alarm and weekday alarm and have both set at the same time. The Alexa app can only handle ONE alarm, so on Sunday night I'll have to remember to set my weekday alarm (luckily it does have a repeat option so I don't have to set it EVERY day). And the speakers leave a lot to be desired. Amazon should partner with Bose or Sonos to crank up the Spot's speaker quality. It would be unstoppable!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, Amazon is PURPOSELY vague/deceptive on the capability of their equipment/software.  For example, the site specifically states the hub is a ZigBee hub, yet it DOES NOT specifically state the hub is NOT AT ALL compatible with Z-Wave.  This is fully deceptive marketing, just state what your product CAN NOT DO!!!!!!!!!!!

Also, Z-WAVE device advertisements on Amazon flat out state they are fully compatible with Alexa, this is FLAT OUT FALSE, and I consider this to be and industry wide marketing LIE!!!!!!!  You CAN NOT connect Z-WAVE devices to this hub, no matter what you read, Amazon will not tell you this unless you buy the hub, connect it, trouble shoot, give up and call them.  Then they say ""oh... looks like the hub is NOT compatible with you Z-WAVE devices, we can allow you to return all the Z-Wave equipment so you can buy more expensive ZigBee products (which probably contain Chinese hack Software).  Rediclous, just be HONEST and tell your customers what your device can an can not do, otherwise you are a bunch of big fat ADVERTISING LIARS.

With that said, to connect Z-WAVE to the Alexa hub, you have to buy a separate Z-WAVE hub, something their tech support will not tell you.  Oh, also, don't trust the FAQ's/help page on the App, they suggest it is simple and you just find you device and the hub (which everyone thinks they just bought a hub because they have the echo plus) but it is %100 WRONG.  You will not know the GE Z-Wave instructions are flat out FALSE until you talk to customer service and they act like you should have known you need a different hub.

One other thing that is irritating is that you have to wipe Amazon devices back to factory just to update your WiFi password.  If you follow the instructions, it will say this is a last resort.  WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!  Not only is this wrong, but I had to teach Amazon that you have to reset their equipment not once, but twice to get it to work.  Then I had to do the full setup again.  To be fair, this applies to their devices which have screens.

The last comment I have is the Alexa App, it has to be the least professional App, least intuitive App, most difficult App on the planet.  It is a TURD.  Why do you not have the same capability on the App within no screen devices for devices which have screens?  Basically you can not control/setup screen devices using the app.  THIS IS JUST STUPID!!!!!

Advise to Amazon:.

Why ruin such an amazing product by supplying a crappy user interface and false/deceptive advertising? Especially the crappy home automation directions, and hub connections?  When you read these instructions, they are FULLY deceptive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_214?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=214&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I like that its small but still has a readable display and that he kids enjoy asking it to do things.
I dont like that it doesnt understand simple commands like ""alexa, how do I name my alarms?"". It tells me something like ""hm, i dont know that one"". By the way, ive tried asking different ways and I still dont know if its possible to name my different alarms. The reason i want them labeled is so that my kids can read the alarm name (right now theyre default labeled as alarm 1, alarm 2, and alarm 3) and know what the alarm is for (e.g. wake up, get ready for soccer, get ready for bed, etc.)
And i would set-up a reminder if it actually reminded them to do the task but im not sure that alexa makes a sound for reminders. It does show the reminder on the screen but my kiddos usually miss it because theyre not in the same room as alexa, and they dont see the screen until way later. Maybe im doing it wrong? I have tried changing the settings but i dont have much to work with.
I have also noticed that my ""do not disturb"" settings dont work properly. I chose to turn off the screen at night but i see the screen lit even after the time i selected for it to turn off. Im not sure if it lights up because the room is lit but why ask for a time if its going to do what it wants? Thankfully this alexa didnt cost us any money (husband won it at work) because, after having used it, i am disappointed that its not very user-friendly. And in case youre wondering, i own several electronics which ive been able to figure out on my own so, i wouldn't say im out of touch when it comes to using electronics.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I hope now that Amazon bought Ring that the performance/ load times become faster, because it can sometimes take a moment or two to load a camera.

I'll be putting these anywhere a screen is needed thanks to its excellent price point. Otherwise, Echo Dots will do just fine!

Multi-room Music. I love this device!","February 5, 2018","Absolutely love the display. Set up was a breeze... I didn't even read the manual. But then I already have 2 echo dots so the familiarity with the whole Alexa system helped in setting this device up. Now, a few notes:
- This has a different power supply from echo dot... maybe because it uses more power. But Amazon decided to move away from the micro USB plug for the Spot... maybe people would not make the mistake of using 500mA power supply? Or maybe Amazon just doesn't want us to use non-Amazon power supplies.
-The display at first was a bit dark for me but I found out that the display (and other things) can be adjusted by simply swiping down from top and going through the menu. And by using the Alexa app on my phone, I was able to upload a picture and use that as the Spot's wallpaper.
- Multi-room music works! So I now have one Dot in the kitchen, the Spot in the living room and one Dot in the bedroom upstairs. I created a group for the kitchen Dot and the living room Spot, and I can now have the same music playing in my living room and kitchen. Cool!
- Songs from Amazon music have lyrics showing on the Spot's screen... instant sing-along! If you have Fire TV this is of course nothing new but having it also on Spot is a good thing.

I'm just hoping this device lasts a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's loud enough for my needs.  Last night I wished Alexa goodnight, she said it back and a picture of an owl and a moon popped up on the screen before it dimmed with the time. Just adorable!

Amazon does it again.","April 10, 2018","This is my 5th echo device.  I have two of the 1st generation, two echo shows and now the Echo Spot.  I put the echo spot in my kitchen.  I use the echo ecosystem as a home intercom.  I have a very large house and don't want to shout at somebody 3 floors down.  The echo spot is sleek enough to fit in my kitchen without being gaudy.  I think they would make a cute alarm clock in your bedroom also.  I don't want any cameras in my bedroom for privacy.  On the echo show you can turn off the camera and mic.  It also has a audio out jack to hook to a larger speaker or stereo system.  Those are cool features that added to the spot.

I am an apple man but love Alexa.  I do have the apple homepod also.  It does not have all the features of the echo but the speakers in that thing are amazing but it is well over priced.  The echo devices are reasonably priced.

The volume on the spot is decent especially since it is so small.  I bought the stand and the glass screen protector.  Many people said the stand makes the audio sound much better.  Over all I am pleased with the spot.  I think all of the echo device have been a hit except for the echo wardrobe.  I think that is what you call it.  I don't even think amazon sells that anymore.

Bottom line small, cute and aesthetically pleasing.  Amazon does it again...!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I now stand corrected.

The Echo Spot is a handy Alexa home automation device that rests nicely on a nightstand; without taking up too much room. The screen is excellent quality, and it automatically brightens or dims relative to ambient room light. Its round shape is unique, and it looks good sitting on a nightstand, a dresser, a bookshelf, or on the kitchen counter.

It's more than just an alarm clock -- it's also an Alexa device. Echo Spot just like an Echo Dot, but with nice graphics and excellent at-a-glance visual information (see photo #1). The sound quality for playing bedroom music is surprisingly good for its physical size.

BONUS: If you happen to have a RING DOORBELL, another nice perk is Echo Spot's ability to show you who is at the front door. Just, say . . .  ""Alexa, show me my Ring doorbell,"" and the screen show what the Ring doorbell sees (see photo #2).  If you happen to be near the Echo Spot when someone rings the doorbell, saying a short verbal command is much quicker than waking up your cell phone and taping several screens to see who's at the front door.

The screen backgrounds can be customized with many themes. Also, the Echo Spot can display pictures from your Amazon Photo Storage account -- either as a screen background or as a slide show. Yes, the screen is small, and I wouldn't want to view a movie on it (although you can), but for all other visual things -- it does the job well.

If you are a fan of the Alex ecosystem, you probably know more about the features of Echo Spot than I. At first, I thought to spend $130 on an Echo Spot was a little extravagant and perhaps unnecessary. Now, I see the Echo Spot as a reasonably priced tool to complement any home automation system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Instead of saying ""computer"", I just say ""Alexa"", and tell her what I want. Music, weather, news, history, sports, no matter what I ask, she responds accordingly.

Installation and updating to latest firmware was the simplest it's ever been on just about any Echo device and 'Alexa' works perfectly.  The form is solid and good quality and the screen is a nice size to sit by the bed; the power cord is a nice length for plugging in to a bedside outlet.  Really like that there's a choice of 'faces' and that there's a weather report built in. The gradually increasing alarm is perfect for couples who get up at different times, or even if you like to wake slowly, and a 'snooze' function that just requires a screen tap is much easier to activate than fiddling around with buttons in the dark.  Also, love that the screen dims automatically for nighttime.

One concern we had in advance is how 'Alexa' would perform with two Echo devices in the same room, the answer is -> flawlessly.  The technology is good enough that both Echo's rings light up but there's an instant 'hand-off' to the Echo nearest to where the voice is coming from.  Well done Amazon engineers.

Would have given this five stars but for 2 irritations:
1) There needs to be a way to silence the alarm without having to verbally ask 'Alexa'.  Tapping the screen only initiates a snooze period and swiping the screen is tough to do with one hand from the bed; how about one tap to snooze and another tap to cancel?
2) Please get rid of the VERY annoying 'Things to Try' screen that rotates through; it really spoils the experience and within a very short time i turned off the rotating screen function simply because it feels like advertising.  Experienced users (aren't we all experienced after a few days?) don't need it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yes, it plays videos  but since it’s so small that feature is really a relevant to me. I was also disappointed to find that I could not connect the echo spot to other Bluetooth speakers in my house.

Item Ad from Amazon stated this would allow viewing of our RING Doorbell and other RING cams. Wouldn't even allow downloading of the skill. Complete rubbish and ad bait. THIS WAS BOUGHT PRIMARILY AS INDICATED, SO THAT WE COULD USE IT FOR OUR RING CAMS.
I speant the better half of a day on the phone between AMAZON and RING management, attempting notification and troubleshoot of the inaction, management of both companies which kept blaming it on the other. Not until I spoke to a humble CSR at RING, which we'll call 'Bob,' did I finally get have a person that understood and had common sense. That man should get a raise, because he actually took the time to speak to his co-workers around him and also call tech amd software support for the answer.
It turns out that RING does create the software for their AMAZON skill and maintain it. However, contrary to what 'AMAZON management supervisor' told me, IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZON'S PROBLEM FOR THE SKILL NOT BEING MAINTAINED AD A DOWNLOADABLE SKILL.
GET YOUR 5%!t TOGETHER AMAZON.
I WILL BE RETURNING THE PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY, AS THEY HAVE DEFAULTED ON THEIR ADVERTISING MESSAGE.
...UPDATE...
Only after I removed the device from the Alexa App, was I able to download the RING Skill. You dropped the ball on this one Amazon. I had already initiated a return and will not be keeping the item.
HINT to AMAZON: Please make sure to be more descriptive in some of the text describing install of certain skills....I digress.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kind of. But this thing just strikes me as something rushed to market without careful consideration. Even the discounted price didn't make it worth it.

The app setup and what's available on the device are not the same. And neither are accurately described in the online help. The initial setup process  in particular is poorly documented. I flailed at trying to make a number of settings changes and use the voice learning before figuring out by accident I had to let it get all the way through the welcome video. Most of the setup screens are non-intuitive as well. Non obvious on the fly, and crappy online help to boot.

The streaming setup options are kind of substandard. No Napster, just Spotify. And evidently that has issues which I discovered when trying to get it working. Only online streaming option appears to be Tune In who want you to buy a subscription. You can't disable the ""Have you asked it this inane and inappropriate question yet? card from constantly displaying on your screen. I could go on and on.

The last and biggest gripe I have with this is that the security and privacy settings are just kind of off or on. You can turn the camera off. But you can't turn off the microphone or disable any functionality except via the top button. No, ""Let me wake up the device and turn things like the alarm on and off, but don't record it when I ask how much something costs or whether Teddy Roosevelt set this.""

I have a sneaking suspicion that all this is by intent. And that the settings are simple and broad because they want you to just leave them on so they can use what do you do and say to monetize your behavior patterns. Which may be the future in store for all of us eventually, but for now I think I will pass. Especially given that after looking this thing over I'm not particularly impressed. I have an old mobile phone I've pressed into service that actually works better as an alarm clock than this. And that's mainly what I wanted it for. So it's going back for now. Maybe sometime in the near future somebody will one up them and give me the smart device that has more than half a brain.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Beyond that, the lack of customization to the display (can't have time and weather on constantly??) - as well as the dull yet rather bright hue still emitted even in night mode.

Was really looking forward to this being released, but it has not lived up to my expectations at all.  Might be returning it.

Ericksen","My favorited Alexa device","February 10, 2018","It just arrived today but of all of my Echo devices (several Dots and an standard Echo) I like the spot the most. I placed this one in my bedroom and it's nice because it's like an alarm clock on steroids. It just quietly sits and displays the time but is ready to respond like any of the other devices.

I do like having a screen for what I use my Echos for the most, including:
* Timers and calculations (they'll show on the screen)
* Asking questions answered by web searches and it's nice to have the screen able to display multiple running timers,
* Yelp rating and address for local business you asked about
* ""Who starred in..."" Images of actors from movies you ask about it'll pull from wikipedia, etc.
* I also use my Echos to control Philips Hue lights, but nothing shows on the screen for that.
* It's also great for re-ordering because you can see on screen that it knows what you mean.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that with trends in electronics design, the size of the bezel dates the tech, the larger the bezel, the older it is and that is a trend across all devices with screens: cell phones, tablets, televisions. So, right out of the box, it already has a more dated feel by not having edge-to-edge screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_429?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=429&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality is far better then the tinny sounding Dot version and the screen makes it far more useful.  My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the silly round screen that is just for design resigns and makes the already very small display even smaller so it can fit square videos/pictures.  I thought only Apple prioritized design over function!

I also waited until it was on sale as the normal $130 is a bit much for what it actually is and the main purpose i bought it for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_70?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=70&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
- perfect size: I was worried it might be too small or too big based on different reviews I had seen, but it somehow manages to be neither.
- very attractive looking: all of my Echo products are white, as it goes better with all the white trim in our house. I was a bit worried about getting the white Spot because in all the pictures, the speaker grill around the bottom seemed so noticeable compared to the black. However, I went with the white, and it really looks great. Its definitely more attractive than the original Echo or the Show.
-clock faces: these are an upgrade in a way from the Show, which doesn’t emphasize the clock functionality. I do hope that the clock faces become even more customizable, but even as they are I really like them.
-night-time mode: automatically switches the clock face to a softer presentation so there are no bright colors

Neutral:
-speaker sound: the sound is lacking in bass, but what would you expect for such a small device? I’ve paired mine with a 2nd generation Echo, and together they sound great.
-3.5 mm audio jack: the Show doesn’t have this, which is okay because the Show is the best sounding Echo, so external speakers aren't all that necessary. If you want better sound with the Spot and you care about multi-room audio, however, you’ll be happy to have this feature since multi-room audio doesn’t work with paired Bluetooth external speakers. I personally do not plan on using the jack as I don’t want another wire coming out the back of the device that will make it less convenient to reposition depending on whether I’m in bed or whether I need to see it from other parts of the room while getting ready.

Wishlist:
-more clock faces / more customization options
-have an auto shut-off for the screen after a certain amount of inactivity. My Show does this and comes back to life when it detects motion in the room. If the Spot can do this, I haven’t found the setting for it yet (with the Show, you have to turn off the ambient clock).
-""try this"" feature: I’d like to be able to disable this in the home cards settings. You can control a lot of individual cards, but not this one. The only way to minimize it is to have the cards rotate once and then stay on the clock until your next interaction. I'd prefer to have it cycle between the clock and the temperature, but in order to do that, I also have to have it show me the ""try this"" card, which gets old after a while.

All in all, I love this new member of the Echo family. It makes so much more sense as a bedside alarm clock than the Show, and it let me repurpose my Show in another room where I wanted more sound quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My old digital alarm clock has been giving me a problem and instead of buying a traditional digital alarm clock, I thought it was time to move on to a ""smarter"" one and chose the Echo Spot. Besides the usual Echo features, I'm going to focus on the Spot's feature as a clock. I love that I can change the clock face to whichever I like. The Spot also dims during night hours, which you can choose the range on. It automatically brightens when you turn on the light at night so can you see the time. By default, the Spot's face displays the time like a traditional digital clock. As for the alarm, it can only only set one alarm at a time (by saying, ""Alexa, set the alarm to 7AM"" among other variations) so when you need a different alarm after your first time, it will erase your earlier set alarm - which is fine, since setting up the alarm is so easy anyway. It can also set up timers and other features. You can choose the sound/tune you listen to as well. This is pretty much the smartest alarm clock you'll get, among the other things this Spot can do (make calls, face time, play music via blue tooth, read to you, etc.). I love this and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go ""smart.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It does what is suppose to do and more, period. People who complaint about sound quality have zero idea of physics. Expecting this little thing to sound like a high end stereo system is plain stupid. For its size, it sound really well. If I want good sound then I go to my high end music system and ask the Echo Spot to play music for me. I had no issues setting it up to control my Nest Thermostat and Lutron Caseta system. I got two Echo Spot, one for my bedroom and one for my living room. On each room I have a Harmony Elite remote. It took me some time to figure how to setup two Harmony hubs with to Echos but after some Googling and reading on forums I got them working right with the two Echos in the same Amazon account and the two Harmony Elite remotes in the same Harmony account as well. As a nightstand alarm clock is just perfect. Really glad I waited for the Spot to get into the Echo ecosystem. 100% recommended!!

UPDATE Jan 10th, 2018: After few days working with my two Echo Spots, I found it's very glitchy. The slideshow doesn't work all the time. Sometimes just stays in clock mode even that I has it in Continues mode. Looks like it detects motion so if nobody is near the Spot the home screen remains on the clock. Same thing happens with the night mode dim function. I have mine set to night mode at 10 pm and back to to full at 7 am. Well today was 11:30 pm and that thing was full bright still then as soon I moved in front of it, it changed to night mode. I'm lowering the score to 4 hopping that a firmware update solve these annoying glitches.

UPDATE Jun 4th 2018: After 6 months with the Spot, I can say that this thing is just GREAT!! After a few updates, there are no glitches and now it has LOT of clock faces to choose from. This is by far the best alarm clock you can have in your nightstand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm new to the Amazon Alexa world so I'm still learning just what this thing can do, but it's so much more than an alarm clock: Waking up in the morning with instant access to my weather, calendar, news feeds and music is awesome. Sound quality is on a par with a few of the mini Bluetooth speakers that I've seen and the screen quality is quite good. My few quibbles are minor: The adjustable stand should have been included with the Spot. As an option, it's WAY overpriced. Also, manually accessing a few features needs to more intuitive (volume, alarm controls). One additional thing: My wife discovered that Alexa could bark and meow! The Echo Spot now gets my dog's stamp of approval too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It is just right for me to sits on my table next to me in my bedroom.  I was struggling to buy the Spot or the Echo Show.  I made the right decision.  I don't have a large house nor do I have small children living with me.  I find this is just perfect and very personal.  No one will see this but me.  I love that.  If I had the Show it would be located in a main Family room.  This is just in my room.

I also like the fact that you can change the color of your clock, change it from digital to analog and also change how you want the streaming of Things to Try. It's easy, just swipe down on your screen and go to settings.  There you can make all the changes you want.  I love when I play Pandora every song is seen by title and author on the screen.  You did not get this with the Echo Dot.  The more I find out, the more I am in love with the ECHO spot.

This one is hands down my favorite.  It is about the size of an Echo Dot (just a bit bigger).  The black one looks truly sharp on a nightstand.  My worry was that it would be too bright at night.  However, there is a setting to have it be truly dim within certain hour ranges.  The screen is very sharp.  Much like the Show, I find it useful to see the cards for weather, lyrics for songs, etc. when asking for information.  Amazon definitely has a winner on their hands here.  Best alarm clock ever.

My only criticisms are the following:

* Screen is too small watch a video (my phone's screen is far larger, and I simply use that).
* Setup for Bluetooth is confusing.  On my other Echos, this is done in the Alexa app.  Here, it is done by asking the Echo to ""open settings"".
* Knowing to ask Alexa to ""open settings"" is not really well publicized.  I only knew to do so from having an Echo Show.

However, none of these criticisms detract from what is an amazing product.  Happy to give 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They also are working to get FreeTime available for the spot and train their reps on how to assist with these content issues with media in the future. I still advocate there should be additional information that is VERY specific for protecting our children from adult content. Like a handout card in the box, or a video that shows you how to put additional filters on the device. It’s 2018. Every parent with children has this in their list of requirements for media at home.

How miserable. 10pm at night and my 4 year old is able to access rated R content. What’s worse, free time isn’t available for this devise, making it impossible to filter ANY content for children. Epic fail Amazon.

Probably better if you can afford lots of Alexa-compatible accessories","February 27, 2019","We got 1 Alexa Spot and 1 Alexa Dot a few months ago.  It can do a lot of great things, but honestly, we mostly use it as a  $130 timer.  We also have it hooked up to a couple of Hunter Symphony ceiling fans.  IF you can get the phone app to connect to the fans, Alexa will step in and it's really convenient to control our ceiling fans with voice commands.

hooking up our garage door or light switches to Alexa sounds really convenient, but $20 per light switch and garage door accessories that require monthly/annual fees isn't very appealing to me.

If you can afford to deck out your house with Alexa accessories, you can probably do some great stuff.  IMHO, just getting an Alexa device by itself probably isn't worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I tried pairing through the Echo Spot and the Alexa app, but the Denon receiver would not appear. I was able to easily pair the receiver with my Echo Dot...it paired up within seconds.

Thankfully I was contacted by Amazon support after leaving my first review of the Echo Spot where I described the pairing issue. I was contacted by Amazon support the following morning. They suggested I try to restore the Echo Spot to it's factory default settings. I restored the Echo Spot and went through the setup process and then finally tried pairing the Echo Spot and the Denon again.

I’m slow to get into technology, so I’m not the type of person who HAS to try the latest gadget. I really needed a new alarm clock and the clock feature first caught my attention. I love the clock and the interchangeable faces you can chose and how you can pick one of your own photos! The alarm choices are pretty great also. No more manually setting your alarms, either...just tell Alexa when you want it set!! It’s fabulous! I also love the “skills” you can add to it—like sleep sounds and SO many other skills—-I still have more to learn about it! Mine came with a smart plug, which really is nice at turning on and off my bedroom light that is on the other side of my room. I don’t know if I am going to use it to make video calls, since it’s in my bedroom, but knowing I can one day change that is nice to know. So, I definitely recommend this, and I have absolutely no buyer’s remorse over this purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_104?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=104&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What I really wanted was not only a great speaker (which this is) but MOST IMPORTANTLY I wanted a reputable and consistent personal assistant.  Time and time again Alexa could not find or provide simple data.  I did side by side comparisons between SIRI, ALEXA, and Google and google won all the time. The replies were more detailed and concise. Since I really will not use this device as a home smart hub, it was paramount that I was able to obtain data on demand and all the time. Alexa came in last. Simple questions like ""What is Mrs Claus First name"" or ""What is at the convention center today"" or ""who played ZUZU""  Alexa could not answer.  GOOGLE did every time.

She can ask Alexa to wake her in time for lunch or dinner or to remind her of appointments, or just to ask what the date is today or the weather.

Cool, not awesome.","May 21, 2018","Follow up:  Some weird stuff going on with repeating alarms.  If we play any Amazon playlist to sleep to, which is put on ""loop mode"" so it will repeat all night, the daily repeating alarms simply won't work.  Tried all the recommendations from tech support, but both our devices do this.  Haven't tried to repeat this on the DOT or Echo, but I'd bet they would suffer the same outcome, since it's basically a back end software issue.  No biggie, we just need to remember to tell Alexa to set an alarm for each device each night and it works as it should.

Additionally, my bride and I listen to ""natural sounds"" to sleep by (i.e. rainfall).  Since we have two devices in the same room and have differing schedules, I named mine ""Echo"", and hers the default Alexa.  If either of us goes to bed, we say ""Alexa (or Echo), play RAIN playlist"", then ""Loop"".  When we say the same thing to the other device when the first one is playing this playlist, the device always says ""playlist rain is playing on another device, do you want to stop playing it on that device and play it on this one"".  You must say ""YES"", which is completely backwards.  Saying YES allows both devices to play the playlist simultaneously, but saying NO, stops you from playing music on the second device.  Weird, right?

Finally replaced my wife's old clock radio with this baby.  She loves it!!  I no longer have to listen to her buzzer every morning, thank God!  Pretty easy set up, as expected.  Am also pretty surprised how okay the sound is out of this little ball.  Head and shoulders over the Echo Dot...not that that's saying much.  Regardless, a really good application is a bedside table.  I'd give it a 4.5, actually, only ding is Amazon's sort of dumb setup requirements. I still don't understand why I can't see all the setup features in the Alexa.  You're forced to go back and forth from app to device to complete ANY Echo device setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And there's no way to fast forward (even on the Show) so you'll have to listen to everything you've already heard. Please, Amazon, fix this!!!!

""Alexa Stop"" results in the audio continuing to play, but highly muted, and then starts in again a few seconds later. Only pause seems to stop the audio.. but same results as above.

Don’t listen to those negative reviews, this is one of the best smart product you can have in your home, if you’re worry about the front cam, you can always buy from amazon a small webcam covers that let you cover and uncover your cam. If you are anoying about the “things to try “ message on this echo , just go to settings , click home content and turn off any messages you don’t want to see and you can turn off the rotate continuously messsges. The sound is great for your clock alarms, also it has an equalizer for you to custom the sound, for better music sound , connect a Bluetooth speaker or connect a speaker with the output in the back of the echo spot. I’m amaze of all this awesome smart products from amazon , I already have the echo diff and fire tv 4k stick, they all work great together !","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Had a few issues with giving it commands but Amazon customer service has been great with helping me fix it.

One of the biggest issues I’ve seen with the reviews is people complaining about the device displaying “Things to try.”
Just want to make it clear that this isn’t “advertising” like everyone is making it seem. It isn’t telling you to try certain apps, restaurants, etc. It’s telling you to try different skills with Alexa. That’s it.

You can choose to have it rotate once so it’ll wait to suggest something else until after you give Alexa another command; until then it’ll just display the time.

It’s great. Just buy it. Use the payment plan if you have to or if you’re that skeptical about getting it.

My biggest letdown is the screen size compared to the plastic case. It's way too small in my opinion especially considering falling screen costs on similar products available in the market. The screen has great resolution but is so tiny that you can't see basic clock numbers from across the room. A larger screen size of 3/4 of an inch would make this device usable in my opinion. Increasing font size on such a small piece of screen real estate makes the clock face look disproportionate. Honestly speaking it's not that usable for me without using binoculars. I would gladly pay an extra 25 dollars more for the size bump. The second major dislike is the forced fed random tips & advertising that I'm not interested in after interacting with Alexa. If I wanted to see a particular tip I would ask Alexa otherwise I want my display to stay clutter free with what I want displayed such as a clock face. These seemingly never ending commercials are annoying enough that I may unplug the device and return it. I'm going to give it a few days before making that decision however am leaning in that direction at the moment. Why Amazon would clutter an otherwise stylish device like this with annoying pop-ups is puzzling. The other functions are great but these two major distractions are worth considering before purchase. I have several other Echo devices that I like but am having buyers remorse with the Spot purchase wishing I would have waited for gen2.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm glad I kept my old reliable clock as a backup through the trial phase.
First, let me be clear that I have TWO Spots in different rooms. They have the same reliability issues. I have very solid Wi-Fi, so much so that my visiting daughter said ""I love the Wi-Fi at Dad's. You can't knock it offline."" I bought the second Spot only after I found very bad reliability issues with the first. Within days, the second had already duplicated the problems of the first one.
The first issue is that it will often (two to three times a week) fail to respond to the wake word, and usually it's in the morning. The blue ring doesn't light up, nothing. On my bedside table, the Spot is only a couple of feet from my face, so acoustics is not the issue. My Dot in the bathroom hears and responds fine. So if an alarm set on the Spot is going off but it's not listening, it won't shut off the alarm. I have to unplug power to kill it. When power is restored it's back to normal.
Final update: I determined through research that the troubleshooting I did was exactly what Amazon support would have walked me through, so I did not bother calling. I still have the same problems with disconnecting or failure to listen at least once weekly. My solution (overly complex for most): I plugged the Spot into a smart outlet that is controlled by SmartThings. When I leave the house now, my ""Goodbye"" routine arms the house, and shuts down power to the Spot. When I get home, the ""I'm Back"" routine disarms the house and turns on the outlet. Since I leave the house at least once daily, this keeps the Spot ""fresh"" when I'm home. However, nobody should have to resort to this kind of workaround. And Amazon Product Development, PLEASE LISTEN to all your customers who want to TURN OFF ""Things to try""!!! That little feature is purely self-service on the part of Amazon, not customer service at all. Just look at all the reviews that would have given the Spot an additional star if it could be turned off. It's overwhelming on anyone's scale.
The second issue is remaining connected to Bluetooth. I have used a number of different Bluetooth speakers, from Samsung to Bose, and the Spot drops connection at least once a week. My old Surface 3, connected by Bluetooth to an identical Samsung speaker, works flawlessly on a daily basis. If the alarm is going off but the Bluetooth is offline, all I'm getting is a silent alarm.
Aside from the very real lack of reliability, I'm also very put off by the ""Try this"" stuff that scrolls across the screen. To me this is useless fluff. I already use Alexa throughout my house for really useful stuff. If I want to ""discover"" new ways to use it, those emails that keep telling me ""What's new with Alexa"" are more than enough. Or I could just ask her. It's like having someone standing in the corner repeatedly saying ""I can do this cool thing."" Very annoying when you just want to see the time and weather.
If the Spots could be made as reliable as the Dots I have around the house, and I could have better control over what's on the screen, this would rate 5 stars. For me, we're a long way from there.
NEW: Within minutes after posting this review I was contacted multiple times by Amazon support (although two of them were for a Kindle that I recently bought for my wife but didn't review). Although I did not yet contact them in return, I did decide to do the regular things like resetting to factory default, reconnect to Wi-Fi, and update the firmware. One Spot was on an older version but the other was up-to-date. Although Bluetooth connectivity seems better, responsiveness after four days was still an issue. Although the Spot wasn't totally unresponsive, it did take nearly a minute (48 seconds on two attempts) to actually respond to a query. Again, the Dot in my bathroom (only three feet farther away than the Spot) responded immediately. The Dot has not been reset for weeks, and that was only because I moved it there from another room. I do intend to contact support to see if anything else can be done, but the common things to try have been done with only limited success.
UPDATE: I still have not contacted Amazon support. However, since the firmware updates, I can confirm that the Spots are only slightly more reliable. My bedside Spot went about a week without becoming unresponsive, but two days after reconnecting it by Bluetooth to a Samsung speaker, it again became unresponsive.

The streaming video and audio quality of the Spot surpasses the quality I have when using Skype/Hangouts on my laptop on an average Internet connection. I don't get much if any lag at all on this device.

A few improvements could be made to make it even better:
- The angle of the Spot is fixed so it takes some time to figure out where to best place it for video calling. The stand that Amazon sells for the Spot does address this.
- Right now, if I want to move the Spot to a different part of the room to video call, I have to unplug the entire charging unit and move that. This means the Spot will turn off as well. If the Spot could be made more portable (through a supported portable battery base), it would definitely solidify its spot as one of the best devices to use for casual video chats.

Overall, an aesthetic device that is great for casual video calls.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Normand","Lack of an OLED display is a single star killer.","February 21, 2018","Solid device.  My only real issue is that its a forgone conclusion that many of these devices are going to find there way into the bedroom.  The display that is on the Spot is a normal LCD display.  The result being at night with the lights off you need to manually dim the display making the time almost impossible to see.  If Amazon had used an OLED display the blacks during night mode would be where the screen is truly off not just dimmed.  Bad design IMHO.  It makes the device cheaper which is good, but every night I'm manually going in and turning down the display to almost off.  The only way to check the time after that is ask the device as I can't see the time with it that dim.

Update:  Voice commands have gotten worse in the last few months.  Lost another star.  Alexa Downstairs lights off.....it turns off every light in the house.

It currently resides on a bedside table, and it's duties are primarily to be a wake up alarm.  The basics, this thing is BUILT, I think I could drop it and it would be fine, but I'm not going to test that.  Great speaker, solid, easy to set up.  Already a ""Prime"" member, so it's a snap.  First thing I did was turn off the camera.  Seems a bit dodgy, that.  If I ever want to make a video call, I'm now ready.  Alexa can be frustrating.  It is fun to tell her to arm phasers and set them to kill.  So, currently, a wake alarm, plays music from my one and only playlist I set up.  Easy to set that up BTW.  The biggest and dumbest thing that I actually can't believe, is Alexa does NOT support wake up playlist shuffling, so here I am, playlist with 27 nice songs and music, and Alexa can ONLY PLAY THE SAME SONG EVERY MORNING.  Now that makes one wonder why have a wake up playlist?  I don't know who is asleep at Amazon in the Alexa department, but this is the single most irritating factor about Alexa and the whole ""echo / spot"" thing you can imagine.  And that's why I only give it 3 stars.  It IS a 5 star device, and it is chopped back to 3 not because of build quality, sound quality, clock quality.  It gets knocked back to 3 stars due a mindless apparently unimaginative ""Alexa"" crew at Amazon.  Come ON GUYS, can't shuffle a play list in the morning, TOTALLY STUPID.

Please consider.....

The personal photograph is a great tool however you should have the option to show the clock in all the options available in other modes for example having the clock show in the middle of the screen or top with the current weather conditions, It will be beneficial to have those options available.

Also there should be a black background option to reduce brightness at night (you can add your own adding a personal photo), another improvement would be when using the wake word the ring or brightness should go up that way you know it is listening.
The camera on the front is a concern if not using video calls but there should be some assurance it cannot be hacked, if not the good old tape trick can ease your concerns. However if you really need an extra surveillance camera at home this can work wonders using the drop in feature.

Another suggestion for improvement would be the ability to use video related skills fully (Ring) to allow 2 way calling when answering the door or seeing someone just like the app, the hardware is there just need the updated software.
I’ll be updating this review after a few weeks of use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you want to do questions and answers about the weather or whatever... go ahead and buy the echo as a glorified toy or voice condilled single speaker radio.

If you want this device to integrate with home automation, do not recommend this as a purchase. Definitely not ready for prime time.

Tech support does not fully understand the system well enough to address involved tech support questions having to do with home automation.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Reminded me of an apple product. The set up was really straight forward. My issues and the reasons for 3 stars started to crop up after I downloaded the app. First, maybe i'm crazy, but when I searched the app store for the app using the alexa keyword, I got several amazon apps. the first was Amazon Prime Music. The Amazon Alexa (music), then Amazon Music. It wasn't hard to figure out which was the one I needed, but the Alexa app is categorized under music which I thought was weird. After downloading, I assumed the app would be a slick, user friendly, and intuitive. I found anything but these characteristics. its clunky, very intuitive and just strange. Amazon, you can do better than this. The whole concept is great, but I really hate the app. Another negative was when I was setting up an alarm (since I plan to replace my bedside alarm clock with this. It took several voice commands to get the alarm set. Through some web searches, i was eventually able to get a weekday alarm set. Not intuitive and Alexa didn't seem to understand to set an alarm for every day. So then comes the alarm choice. What a weird selection of tones. Come on Amazon, you can do better. So not I decided I would rather wake to an i heart radio station. I tried dozens of commands to get alexa to do this (no the app wont let you just type in what you want, in fact the app doesn't even indicate that this is possible). Finally, I went back to the web to do searched to find out how to do this. I eventually found the exact wording to make this happen. I assumed alexa could do this stuff, but I am finding it very limited. Oh yea, dont even try and understand how to hit snooze or cut of the alarm. I dont want to talk to alexa in the morning and wake my wife, just want to touch a screen or button to make this happen. Eventually figured it out,but again, totally not intuitive at all. So Amazon, great concept, its just not there yet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_150?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=150&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Content that is 16:9 is either clipped so badly that you cannot see what's going on, it is shrunk so small you cannot see what is going on.  If you watch older content that is 4:3, you can see that better, but the corners are rounded off.  Also, it is so small, it is really hard to focus on what is being shown.  Do not plan to watch Amazon Prime Video on this.

The screen auto-adjusts to the ambient light level in the room, but it really does not get dark enough at night.  I had to pick a black clock face to even get close to a dark enough screen to sleep.  It is an upgrade over the bright blue LED digital alarm clock I had before it.

There is no YouTube for the Echo Spot, nor the Echo Show.  Amazon and Google are mad at each other, so we as the customer have to pay the price.  I watch a ton of YouTube on my Roku TV, and wanted to do the same with my Echo Show and Echo Spot, but neither can play ""internet video"" as it tells you when you try.

There is no repeat alarm.  So, I want the Echo Spot to set a wake-up alarm each weekday at 05:30, but you have to tell it to set an alarm every night.  Additionally, it does not understand 24 hour time, so it keeps asking ""Is that in the morning or the afternoon?"" because it does not know which 5:30 I am talking about (AM or PM).  The snooze activates too easily.  You need to swipe up to turn the alarm off, but if you do not get a full swipe, it snoozes nine minutes and then goes off again.  This is annoying to my wife, since she sleeps in later than I do.  I can tell Alexa to stop the alarm, but then I am just making more noise to wake her up.

This is a good way to bring Alexa into the Bedroom, but an Echo Dot will do most of the same stuff you want in an alarm clock replacement and a fraction of the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_408?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=408&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It always felt half-baked but ahead of it's time and I loved it fiercely. The Chumby servers went offline a few years back taking all the devices with them and I've been looking for a replacement ever since. This is everything the Chumby was and wanted to be. While I'm offput by the camera I still elected to place it on my nightstand and use it as an alarm clock. I am extremely light sensitive (hotel room smoke detector LEDs are the bane of my existence) when sleeping and so was worried about having an always-on screen next to my bed but was surprised to find that the auto-brightness on the screen goes very very low automatically and the clock face switches to a black face with yellow hands which further reduces the brightness. It's enough that I can easily sleep with the Spot on my nightstand, facing(watching) me at eye-level, something I cannot do with any other alarm clock.
I'm also rather impressed with how smart Alexa is. She can recognize some very obscure requests and even handle follow-up questions:
ex: ""Alexa, will it rain today?""
""No rain is forecast today""
""Alexa, what about tomorrow?""
""No rain is forecast tomorrow""
She was even able to recognize my request for Ludovico Einaudi on the first try which is especially amazing being that I'm sure I butchered his name.
The second complaint I have (after the dumb camera) is that Amazon has the separate ""Prime Music"" and ""Amazon Music Unlimited"" services. Prime Music doesn't include a lot of the songs I request and Amazon Music Unlimited costs more $$ each month. What's super annoying is that Alexa feels the need to try to sell Amazon Music Unlimited everytime I request a song Prime Music doesn't offer. You can change the default library to Spotify but not Apple Music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_95?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=95&reviewerType=all_reviews"

To me, though, it represents something more as I get ready to return to work after being laid off 6 months ago. To get back into the routine of waking up early on weekdays, I *need* an alarm clock now, and the Spot is my early ""new job"" present. I was delighted when it was delivered a whole day before the official release date. Echo Spot is a metaphor for Alexa sneaking into the earliest, most vulnerable part of your daily routine, and in my case it's a very exciting journey as I return to a regular 9-to-5 (with *pay*). Enough about my plight--how will this thing work for YOU?

OVERALL CONCLUSION
======================
Four stars out of five because Echo Spot's screen is a useful addition to Alexa, the overall aesthetic design is great, the sound is very good for a tiny speaker, BUT the price is high and the video ecosystem is immature (and not ideal on a round screen). You should buy it if you really need a fancy device in the kitchen or bedroom and you have this amount budgeted for an ""extravagant"" gadget for yourself or loved one. Otherwise, wait a little while until the price eventually decreases.

WHO SHOULD BUY AN ECHO SPOT?
==================================
The Echo Spot is one of the more expensive ways to enter the Alex ecosystem. It has a screen, which none of the other small speaker versions have. Only the angular (ugly?) tablet-on-stand Echo Show has a screen, but that's where the differences end.
✓ If you care about style and want to put a device in the bedroom, on a desk at work, or in the kitchen, the Spot would look great.
✓ If you want to see the live video feed from a Nest/Dropcam/Ring, etc. camera, watch a video (albeit a limited selection right now), see reminders, lists, song lyrics and recipes, that screen is really helpful.
✓ If you want an upgrade to the Dot (whose speaker isn't really meant for music) and have about the same amount of money to spend as the Echo (Gen 2), the Spot should be on your shortlist. The Echo G2 wins for sound quality by a small margin, but the Spot wins big for versatility with its screen and hardwired line-out for an external speaker (which the larger Echo Show inexplicably lacks, supporting only Bluetooth and not corded external speakers).

HOW DOES THE SCREEN LOOK?
=============================
Good, not great. The resolution is excellent, somewhat close to retina, but the brightness is just OK, the glare is waaaay worse than I wanted (similar to the new/cheap Fire tablet screens, which lack the gapless lamination you'd find on the older/expensive Fire tablets and of course on all modern iPads). These previous factors coupled with the visible (but not terrible) color-shifting at extreme viewing angles make me realize how spoiled I am with flagship phone and tablet screens in the last 2-3 years. This is not a top-tier smartphone display, but I have to give a lot of credit for the cool-factor of a perfectly round screen.

ARE VIDEOS WATCHABLE?
=========================
I looked up a recipe for the ever-sumptuous pannacotta. To my delight, the Spot immediately took me to allrecipes.com with a video on how to make an easy version of this Italian dessert. The video was zoomed in to fill the circular screen, and it looked surprisingly ""normal"". It's not likely that Amazon somehow curated videos for ones that look good on a circle screen, so my assumption is that most video producers just center tightly on their subjects and we actually don't use the sides of our rectangular screens very much.
That being said, I couldn't stand to watch long-form content on this tiny screen. Moreover, where is YouTube? Please end this fight, Amazon and Google. Maybe it will be available in 2018. Until then, recipes from non-Google sites are the killer app for the Spot, and they are a tremendously useful feature.

HOW IS THE SOUND?
====================
I own the Echo Dot (gen 2) and the Echo (gen 1), and the sound of the Echo Spot is somewhere between them. If the Echo Dot is 30 in quality and the Echo is 100, the Spot is probably a 70 or perhaps even 80. It's going to forego a lot of bass richness, but I listened to many hours of music this week and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sound actually was. It's certainly better than any other speaker I've had in a bedroom or at work, which is where the majority of these will end up. If you want even better sound, then buy a nice Bluetooth speaker as a satellite, but the Echo Spot already sounds as good as the $50 little Bluetooth cubes a co-worker had at my former job. It's got a standard stereo out port and Bluetooth streaming, so if you need better speakers now or down the road, you can expand.

WHAT ARE SOME THINGS YOU LIKE?
=================================
✓ Design, weight, premium feel
✓ Very responsive touch screen
✓ Lyrics for songs (the killer app for old Christmas carols, wow!)
✓ Recipes
✓ Video calling (worked well with my Alexa app on my Android phone)
✓ Voice drop-in / intercom
✓ Custom photo upload for background
✓ Simple, uncomplicated UI, and most things, even Wi-Fi setup, don't need the Alexa app--this is a good gift for people who aren't bonded to a smartphone
✓ Easily watch Amazon video content (but on a tiny screen)
✓ Multi-room features are INCREDIBLE. During setup, I had my Echo Dot in the same room, and Alexa just *knew* (ESP is a great name) which device I was talking to; playing music in all rooms is nifty as well...
✓ Mics and voice recognition seem just as good as all the other Echo devices, even though Spot seems to have only 4, not 7 like my original Echo and new Echo Dot both have

THINGS LESS LIKABLE?
======================
❌  Power cord is not USB--why can't this just be a USB-C device?!?
❌  Not a lot of clock faces, just 6 analog and digital right now; I do LOVE the ""bokeh"" clock face, though, which is a geeky photographer's term that refers to those out of focus rings made by lens aperture blades
❌  Can't watch many video sources, yet
❌  Expensive--this thing is as overpriced as the original Echo, so expect it to drop to about half the current level in 1-2 years
❌  Screen is silly small for watching longer videos or videos that can't be cropped to circular proportions
❌  No way to really ""stop"" video--it started again on its own today, which was beyond annoying because I had left the room at least 5 minutes beforehand and heard it resume from across the hall
❌  UPDATE: You can ""tap"" anywhere on the touchscreen while the alarm is going off to snooze for 9 minutes. Very cool! Thanks to commenter Smokey DeBear for correcting me. (Original statement, now no longer valid: Utility as an alarm clock relies on using your voice--no dedicated buttons or intuitive way to snooze, etc.)
❌  Camera could be a risk for those concerned about privacy and can't be *truly* disabled aside from blackout tape (which apparently stops the motion sensor and auto-brightness as well)

ABOUT THE PHOTOS
===================
I wanted to include some common fruit for size comparison, so the logical sequence is to show you a grapefruit and tangerine so that you can visually see the Spot is about the size of a large orange. My wife then decided that Spot was ""lonely"" and needed ""friends"", so the two citrus fruits got faces, courtesy of a black Sharpie. Hopefully she'll keep the marker away from the Spot itself!
To show an example of a custom clock face, I then took a photo of the grapefruit with the smiley face and made it the ""face"" of the Echo Spot. It was already round, so the cropping worked really well. You can upload any photo from your phone and zoom/crop to fit.

UPDATE AFTER 5 DAYS
====================
Everyone who has come over for holiday gatherings has been amazed by the sound quality. It's a tiny form factor for such rich sound.

I realized that the motion sensor will enable lyrics display as you walk up to it, waking it from the clock mode if music is playing. Neat!

My phone is suddenly becoming less useful to call people because the speakerphone quality of the Echo Spot is just incredible. Everyone I've called says the audio on their side is amazing. Alexa wakes up and processes voice commands so much quicker than ""OK Google"" on my Nexus 6P, so it's more convenient to call when I'm near an Echo device.

The kids love playing 20 questions and The Magic Door with Alexa. The Spot's screen doesn't help much with those, but I can definitely see other games/skills being built to entertain kids (and big kids) for hours. This could be a great homework helper in the future as the ecosystem evolves . . . ""Alexa, how do you spell syzygy?"" and the word appears on the screen as Alexa reinforces with spoken letters, S-Y-Z-Y-G-Y.

UPDATE AFTER 4 WEEKS
=====================
Things that cracked me up the most: ""Alexa, sing a barbershop quartet"" and ""Alexa, sing auld lang syne."" The first is pretty bad, but Auld Lang Syne is FABULOUS and obviously has some human backup singers.

Things I'm totally addicted to: I use the Echo Spot as a remote portal to check-in with the kids while I'm working remotely. I ""drop in"" on their Echo Dot and have been reading aloud to them (""Lord of the Rings,"" if you're curious) for an hour or so, a few times a week. The speakerphone quality is phenomenal and the connection is very stable. I wouldn't be able to do this on my cellphone.

Lists galore: I now have half a dozen lists going because it's so easy to make lists and add stuff via voice. I worry that my short-term memory will be totally gone in a few years as I now depend on virtual assistants for everything . . .

ALSO, responding to another reviewer, the clock's time size is big on the INCLUDED clock faces! See the last photo I just uploaded. Amazon must think that if you have a personal photo uploaded, you want the time to be small (which makes sense--you can see your photo better), so if you want the numbers large, just don't upload a personal watchface photo. Maybe they'll give an option to change that in the future, but it's not a big deal, in my opinion. Finally, if you walk up to the Spot and the camera senses your motion, the display will change to the weather or reminders, etc. Therefore: it's only big when it senses no motion (you're far away) and you've got a stock clock face. Pretty smart!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I had been using Google home for all my smart home or voice activated devices for years and been very happy.  Or so I thought, that was until Alexa came into my life.  She has awoken a new, better, younger, happier home owner in me.  One whom had forgotten that I deserved an AI with a real personality,  An AI not afraid to cut up and make jokes to lighten the mood after a hard day's work.  One that feels confident enough to sing me a song should I need it.  An A.I. that knows me for me,  that wakes at just the hint of my voice whispering her name... Alexa... Then practically begs to assit my every need.
So while I still let Google live with Alexa and myself and occasionally use it for trivial tasks just so it doesn't feel totally worthless, Alexa (Echo Spot) and I are quite happy and look forward to a long happy life... And if she plays her songs right, maybe even a few little Echo minis around the house some day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A great add to the Amazon Alexa family. Easy to setup and works like a mini version of the Amazon Show. The camera features are nice if you like to use drop-in.  You can also disable the feature in the menu if you don’t use the video portion. The device has an auto dim feature that can sense light so it won’t be bright in a bedroom if you want to use it for the alarm clock feature. Sound quality is also great for a small device. You will be suprised with the audio quality.  Smart integration works well too. I have my Arlo cams and Ring doorbell skills synced and works flawlessly.

I hated the idea of a ""connected"" home.  Then my mother in law bought us echo dots for Christmas.  We purchased the Echo Spot to allow for us to video call our family members and even my 4 year old can operate Alexa.

There are some things to learn, but Alexa in conjunction with the Alexa app allow us to video call anyone on iPhones or Androids.  All that is required is that they install the Alexa app.  It is as simple as saying ""Alexa, call X"" and voila, it connects.  It defaults to video connection first but if there is only an audio call available, it seemlessly switches.  The sound quality is VERY good for a package this small and I am nearly deaf.  The screen is bright and clear and you can adjust the brightness to suit your needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’m going to keep the spot but if you want great sound and don’t need a screen I would recommend the echo spot for an economic option or the echo, both are still cheaper than the spot.

I set the Spot up by my computer for convenience.  What I get is a continuous list of things to try and what's trending on the Internet.  Really annoying.  After a lot of Googling I finally figured out how to get rid of most of the messages coming across the screen and learned that this is a widespread frustration.  Amazon makes it difficult for you to find out how to do this in the settings menu.  They call all these messages ""rotations"".  Amazon technical support confirmed that you can't get rid of the suggestions of things to ask Alexis to do - Amazon isn't listening to their customers on this issue.

I've now been playing around with the Echo Spot for a couple of weeks and read the book ""Amazon Echo Spot"".  Hence an update to my initial review. Do you want to watch movies on a 3"" screen; use the clock for selfies or to view your photos; view your to-do list on a clock; or would you rather use the big screens of your computer or TV as well as your cell phone/tablet for these activities.  At 5 times the cost of an Echo Spot, you are getting an expensive clock without useful features you don't already have on the Echo Spot or your other electronics.  It looks cool, but doesn't provide value.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Echo spot does everything the Echo dot does and it does it perfectly. There are a few nice extras that the screen provides such as:
1) Lyrics to words to songs you hear on Amazon music and interesting song facts using music Genius
2) It can display the weather graphically and show you 3 day forecast
3) You can upload your person picture to use a screen-background
4) It can show you a small squeezed size picture of your RING camera video (too small and cannot be enlarged)

However, notifications, from skills like Dominoe's Pizza, Amazon Shopping, Life360, etc only display a sound instead of turning the ring a color Yellow.  So if you are not there to hear the sound, you will never know you had a notification.

Lastly, without for the Price, its simply not worth getting !!  The Amazon Dot can do practically everything you'll need and until Amazon gets you Tube Support - I would not recommend buying the Spot at over $100 - too much money for too little bang !!

(Switched to a Samsung phone) I have to say my favorite feature is the ability to tell Alexa to set an alarm for any time and tell her what music to play straight off my Spotify account for it. It looks very clean and crisp and only takes up a small spot on my nightstand. Just like all the other echo devices it works great for asking various questions. Getting the weather first thing in the morning is nice. There are also a number of different backgrounds and clock faces to choose from to make it interesting. Sound quality is great and music sounds clean and crisp. At first I was worried about having a screen next to me at night for a clock because even on dim most displays are still too bright. The spot when in night mode and senses little to no light gets super dim. Enough that I can still see the time but doesn’t create any excess light so that is a super plus. Setup was really easy and the phone app makes it easy to adjust finer settings.

As for the CONs I don’t like how it cycles through the “things to try” without the ability to turn it off. I would like just having it cycle through the clock face and the weather. A little annoying but nothing too serious. Hopefully an update fix down the road. Another thing I noticed was the lack of ability to display 24hr time. I’m so used to it that switching back to the a.m./p.m. is sometimes a pain. Finally is the lack of a backup battery in the event of a power outage. The old clock radios I used to use would at least have a battery backup so if the power went out my alarm would still sound. Because the spot requires an outlet, good luck waking up on time if power is out during your alarm time.

Overall very fun piece of tech I enjoying using and having around. Hopefully I can use the full function of the smart home someday as this little sucker can do quite a bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I already have my smart home setup with another assistant. Adding the spot to my home was painless. Just add the skills to Alexa, ask her to discover new devices and within seconds I was ready to go.

Upload pictures and movies to your Amazon photos account, then sort them into albums and your can watch all your personal home videos on it, and watch your favorite pictures work as backgrounds for your clock. It dims very low when all my lights are out and doesn't bother me at all when trying to sleep. You can also tell Alexa to turn off the screen and it'll go completely dark.

I wasn't sure about the echo show, that looks great for a room, computer desk, or other area, but the spot is PERFECT for the bedroom, right beside the bed. My friends are really impressed with it as well.

Trivia, games, reading my books, movies, even reading my Twitter feed, it has it all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s small, powerful and just a pleasure to use. The sheer number of possibilities it creates for use is staggering and continues to increase exponentially. It replaces an alarm clock, mini speaker, small screen enhanced Echo.

The ONLY two minor complaints that I have are somewhat trivial. The first is that the speaker, while usable could be substantially better and from industry experience, would add nearly nothing to the price.

The second is that because of the round shape of the screen not everything displays in a fashion that is conducive for use. All that it would need is a tweak in software to correct this and it would be infinitely more usuable.

I have found the optional stand gives it a massive increase in placement scenarios. I would recommend it to anyone. Although it works well without if you want to save the $15. Don’t beat yourself up.

The bottom line is you will be happy you bought it and never think twice about spending the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_57?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=57&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No app required.","March 30, 2018","Such a fun, quirky little clock to sit on my desk. I had the Amazon Alexa Echo sitting on my desk before but, I wanted something a bit more useful. So I purchased this, along with the stand. Set up was quick and simple. Because of the touch screen, I didn't have to use the Alexa app like I did with the Echo. Everything was set up right on the screen. In the Welcome email you get from Amazon, it does tell you to get the app, but I didn't use it once for the setup process. The screen seems to be good quality and I have no complaints about the sound. I think the Echo gave a bit more bass, but this one is just fine. Being that it sits right here at me, I don't need it to be loud. It has a jack in the back and is also bluetooth so if you really need better music from it, you could always get a little speaker for it. I find that I personally don't need that. So here's some things I like/don't like about this little thing:

Touch screen which makes it easier to set up than the echo and dot.
Multiple clock faces to choose from, including the ability to make your own.
Different events, such as weather and news will scroll across the screen.
Lyrics of songs that you request it to play scroll down the screen and it keeps up pretty well. I did notice some lag when the songs had pretty fast lyrics but it did a pretty great job otherwise.
My son loves coming in and randomly asking Alexa to show him different pictures of animals and it does. One of the animals he asked to see was a Llama. Because of the way the screen is, rounded, it cut off the Llama's head completely. I think the resolution may need to be tweaked on Amazon's side or smaller bezel, not sure. It was funny to us when we noticed it.
It's small, about the size of a softball, maybe a touch bigger. Fits perfect on my desk.

When it comes down to it, it's a nice little upgrade from the Echo. I got mine while it was on sale. I wish I would have gotten two! One for desk and one for bedroom! I can't comment on how it works as an alarm clock, as I just use my phone for that. As a replacement for the echo, it's definitely an upgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's voice recognition is fairly spot on and I have never felt like I was misunderstood when asking Alexa something. It's been immensely convenient. There's a couple of small things that irk me though, such as the fact that although it will recognize my contacts when I say ""call ___"", if i ask it to show me all my contacts, neither my parents nor half of my friends appear.

 It also doesn't show you what skills you already own. If you say ""show me my skills"" or ""what skills do I own?"", Alexa will ask if you'd like to download the three most popular skills on the market. This makes it really easy to lose track of the skills you downloaded prior.

I was wish there was more flexibility into what you see on the home screen. I love knowing the weather and time, but I really don't care for the ""things to try"" page. It'd be more nice to have that page for things such as ""Don't forget to meditate today with your HeadSpace skill"" or ""Tell Alexa about your day with your MyJournal skill"". Ya know? Something that applies to me.

Lastly, the routine program could use some major tweaking. Some of the vocal replies sound really awkward and I would have hoped that the language engineering team put more effort into making at least the default expressions listed sound natural. Also you can't open skills as part of your routine so you can only check the weather, receive an awkward automated reply back, play a song, or hear the about the news... you might as well just go to your home page.

I understand this is just me being knit-picky, especially with regards to the access of skills, but I also hope that someone who is working on the next software update reads this review and takes it into consideration for improvements. Fix these couple of things and the Echo Spot will be darn near perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a few VERY minor quibbles with how things are done, but that's down to me learning how to tell my dear friend what I want to do. I think we might get more of these and put them all over the house. Need to save up for that, though. By the way, I got a stand for it, which makes it look even more cool and allows it to swivel.

(I Figuered It Out)","December 26, 2017","I have 3 Echo Dots in the house & mom & I really like them. When I heard about this a couple of months ago I jumped right on the pre-order train. It caught my attention because the Echo Show was interesting to me but it was just way to big. I wanted something that I could use as a clock by the bed, currently I was using my Moto 360 watch (it turns into a simple clock dial when docked). So this would replace two things on the stand (my watch as a clock & the Echo Dot). I absolutely LOVE it. / What I really wasn't fond of were the clock dials, all I wanted was a simple clock (all black background & white numbers), sadly that option isn't available as a choice... but there is a work around!

As you can see in the pics it's VERY dim at night when the lights are off & it's bright & clearly visible when the lights are on but still stays as a simple black & white clock.

For those that want to know how to achieve this:

1.) The main thing is to turn on the ""Night Mode"" ""Nighttime Clock"" (pic3) and set it to run 24hrs a day.

2.) Turn on the ""Adaptive Brightness"" & crank up the brightness, you can see how high I set mine in the pic (pic4), but you can fine tune  this setting to your liking (this is the setting that actually controls how bright it is in the day & how dim it is at night).

3.) Choose the ""Street Lights"" or ""Bokeh"" digital clock.

4.) That's it, once you make those setting just wait about a minute for it to go back into standby mode and your ""simple clock"" will fade in.

Oh, for those that have an issue with the screen cycling through all the the displays non-stop (Clock-Weather-Things To Try, etc.) & just want it to stay on the clock face of your choosing, the way to achieve that is to go into Settings>Home & Clock>Home Card Preferences, click on ""Rotate Once"".

Hope this helps someone. ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

While I believe the basics is acceptable, I think unless you have some home automation accessories, Echo Spot is not that useful.  This is acceptable as I'm in the process of adding some home automation items.  The most annoying  thing is when Alexa speaks, the ""speak"" volume is great except when she does a sound effect or plays music those volume comes in at a lower volume.  Ok.  Another annoying thing is when I ask Alexa to do something, she responds correctly but when I give the same command again (another day), she does not understand.  My wife does the same thing so maybe this isn't a flaw but, it is annoying.

Jacobs","Usability of alarm dismiss needs some work","February 1, 2018","This is a more functional replacement for the combination of the Echo Dot and my regular alarm clock - nice to have one device replace 2 that were there before - and obviously takes up a lot less space that the Dot + Clock combination that I had before.

The sound as others have stated is pretty good for such a small device. But honestly I don't use it much for that - certainly not for music as I have various Sonos connected speakers throughout my home. However - as with other Alexa enabled products now - it is easy to use it to play music in my bedroom or bathroom - so that is nice - and that was basically most of what I was using the Dot for before I replaced it with the Spot.

The big negative to me is that I am not a snoozer - I could care less about being able to easily snooze my alarm. I would much rather the single tap simply turn the alarm off for the day - but of course keep it active for the next day if it is a recurring alarm. I typically have one alarm set up just for the weekdays and have none on the weekend. So it is important that the easiest gesture be to simply turn it off without completely deactivating it - and not snoozing it. I get up before my wife typically - so I don't want to wake her to tell Alexa to stop the alarm - it has to be a touch gesture. And yes - I know I can swipe up to dismiss the alarm - but that gesture is problematic. Often I end up just snoozing it because as I go to swipe up - that first touch registers the snooze and the swipe up doesn't have the desired effect. And if I don't go into the app to see whether or not the alarm has been deactivated I run the risk that it will go off again when I am in the shower and wake my wife up. Not good.

So - the single touch gesture needs at least to be configurable to either cause a snooze or to simply turn the alarm off for that day - but to keep it active if it happens to be say a recurring weekday alarm like I have set up.

As it stands now - it is borderline unusable for my use case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_68?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=68&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the echo show and was nervous about the quality of the camera but there were no specs on Amazon. It does video calling but the video is low resolution and audio is not fantastic.

The drop in isn’t exactly working between spots. When I drop in on my brother, it goes to my mom, and when my mom drops in on me, it really drops in on my brother. I’m really confused as to how that happened, because we each have a profile. Also, my old contacts from a phone that was destroyed are still in the Echo app, and it hasn’t synced my new contacts. Also, when my boyfriend called my spot, it went to my mom, so that was pretty embarrassing. I’m really confused on what to do on my own and will be contacting amazon to try and get this straight. It is a great device and I would definitely recommend again. If you don’t like the camera, you can get a camera cover for spots.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I cut either of them back on the clock is correct. This is an electronic clock and more that can be turned on or off at any time. This saves both electricity and data allowance.

After having one for a couple of weeks, I am loving it! I love the fact that you can actually see what Alexa is doing. I love the lyrics that scroll when music is played and the fact that it is self contained is nice too. Almost all of the settings can be modified by simply swiping down from the top of the screen. Speaking of the screen, it is bright, clear, and easy to read even in direct sunlight and the viewing angle is great. I disabled the adaptive brightness because it would go completely dark (black) screen at night. The bluetooth connectivity works without flaw.

Only thing I would like to see more of is the clock skins. I found one that I like but it would be nice to be able to create one with widgets maybe. Sure, it scrolls things like the weather and top news but it would be cool to style my own. Maybe I just haven't found the settings to do so.

I tried making telephone calls with it, and it works beautifully, not just to echo users but to any phone. I would like to see more choices for the clock faces with the next update. There seems to be no way to download additional ones using the Alexa app. The ones included are OK, limited, and, for people with older eyes, a little small. My husband couldn't see the clock the first night, so I turned off the night dimming function, cranked the brightness up to maximum, and found a digital face without a lot of background clutter (there are 6 digitals to choose from). I would love to see a digital face with no picture in the background, just a screen with a dark color like black or blue or purple.

It's small enough to place just about anywhere","December 23, 2017","I've got one of each kind of Echo except for the Echo Look. This one is my favorite. It's small enough to place just about anywhere, and I LOVE having a screen. I put this in my media room and use it to control my lights. I don't have a clock in that room, so the screen is a great way to check on the time and more. The Echo Show was just too big on my end table, but this little guy is just right.

Set up was a snap. I think it found my other Echos so it didn't need anything beyond customizing the settings. I'm not sure if the Echo still needs a smart phone to connect with your Amazon account, but they really, Really, REALLY need to fix that if they haven't already.

I find the background to be a little too dark, as I do with the Echo Show. I would like to have independent settings for background brightness and overall brightness. I'd also like to have different volume settings for media versus alarms and Alexa's voice--but that's more of an issue with the Echo Show.

Doesn't bring much to the Alexa device table.","November 29, 2018","Been using it for about a week.  Replaced a gen 2 echo dot that we had for a while.  Also have a full size echo in my house.

Pros:  Looks really good on a night stand.  Functional as a clock and alexa device.  Decent amount of settings and tweaks you can make (minus how you access those).  Speaker is superior to the Dot I replaced.

Cons: Screen is too small to really have any use other than a clock face.  Most skills/app are not optimized for the tiny, circular screen.  Most force a ""square"" picture that makes it even smaller/harder to read.  Even the weather is too hard to read to really be useful.  Also not sure if its just the zillion people who just bought one using it or what, but Alexa seems 'slower' on this device than my other echo devices.  Takes a few extra seconds to respond compared to the dot.  Not a terrible lot longer, but long enough I notice the pause.  Finally, the settings have to be access ON the device using the tiny touch screen.  This makes configuring it slightly painful, although not impossible.  Also if you want a black background with white clock face (you know, the standard for alarm clocks since forever) you have to do some major shenanigans.  I had to make an all black, square picture on MS Paint on my computer.  Upload it to my ""Prime Photos"" account.  Then target the Spot to my prime photos in a setting buried about 5 menu's deep on the device's tiny screen.  The picture must be in its own album on prime photos or it will try to slideshow every picture you have uploaded also.  Thats a lot of extra steps to make it look like a normal clock guys.  If you like weird backgrounds/color on your clock face they have you covered though.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Big mistake. Although I have it set to rotate screens only once, the constant lighting changes in the room cause the Spot to frequently show the ""Things to Try"" screen which can't be disabled. It's distracting when watching TV and annoying when you look at the Spot for the clock and don't see it.

I ""fixed"" it by covering the camera with a sticker. But for something that costs as much as the Spot does, I really shouldn't have to do this. An option to always show the clock is much needed here.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I got it for my bedroom and it works great as an alarm clock and Alexa device.

One of the most notably features is the screen which adds extra functionality over the standard audio-only Echo devices. It displays time, supports video calls, touch input, Amazon Prime Video, etc. Because the screen is circular video is cropped, zoomed in, or both.

I bought an Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as my second device and I realized a few things which are surprising considering the Dot is the cheapest device by far. One is that the range the Dot can hear me exceeds my Spot... I've been right next to the Spot and had the Dot answer me from the other room instead. Second is the speaker on the Dot is much better than the Spot. I know the newest Dot has improved audio but I've always been under the impression that the Spot was better and that's not the case at all. Last, the Dot responds to commands that the Spot doesn't know. For instance I can say turn off all devices and the Dot does this and the Spot instead says ""there is no device called 'all devices'"".

Jenkins","An insomniac's dream!","May 15, 2018","I am so happy to have made the decision to get this. I attended a health and wellness seminar and they talked about the importance of sleep and not having devices near you. Now it's going to seem ironic to talk about a device that's on my nightstand, but is very different than reaching for your phone. I have programmed my Alexa app to set an alarm every morning and when I wake up I tell it to start my day. Alexa gives me the weather and my flash news briefing that I have set up to customize for my area. I synced up my Spotify premium account and my audible books. My Prime shopping orders I can just speak into the phone and I can call up Prime videos or music as well.

However, as I've had trouble sleeping these days in the middle of the night while I'm laying there in bed I just turned to my Alexa and ask her to play me a guided meditation. Some nights I asked her to play me an ocean sound playlist and set a timer on that for 15 minutes as I fall asleep. This is been really really helpful. The video on it is clear and I love the clock face. I am not using it so much as a speaker for my music, however I find it to be very good to just play music while I get ready. The true magic comes and how you can program Alexa to do the things that you want, but with spot you get to see video of your favorite things that you'd like to see as well. And lastly, it's super cute sitting on my nightstand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Being able to have a visual instead of just a speaker was nicer than I thought. Obviously being a lot smaller than my old echo, I was also worried that the sound for this Spot wouldn't be as good, but so far I haven't noticed any significant sound differences. That being said, I'm not the type of person to play music super loud or with a heavy base, so it may or may not handle more extreme sounds just fine. THE ONLY CON I'VE ENCOUNTERED SO FAR is that I find it slightly annoying that for certain actions or commands, once I'm done I have to tell it to go back to the home screen, it won't change back automatically. But to say ""Alexa, home screen"" takes two seconds and is not enough for me to knock down my rating to four stars.
BOTTOM LINE:  I'm happy with my Echo Spot!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When connecting to all of my other amazon devices to play music throughout the house, it will disconnect the dots from blue tooth speakers and play on its little speaker.  Works great with my original echo for this.  For some reason after adding this device, Other echo dots loose network.  I think I have too many too close to each other and it seems to overwhelm the system.  I thought I would be able to launch apps on this device and watch Netflix or Sling TV like the fire TV, if you can I have not figured it out.  To view my cameras, I was able to connect one of the camera apps to Alexa app but can not ""show me"" this camera.  I probably need to sit down and try to figure this out, just thought it would have been more user friendly and less putsy to have everything work together.

This is a SCAM and clearly in not intentionally mis-leading. What good is a Door Bell if you have to sleep with your iPhone in order to see who is at the door, great when you're not at home, but that's not the issue here. I give this a negative 5 Star review, also Ring Customer support doesn't do a good job, as soon as you get on the phone after waiting 20 minutes you're not allowed to ask a question, they ask a whole bunch of questions to verify I own the Ring device. I mean why else would I be calling. Do not purchase this if you want it to ring inside your home as well as appear on your smart phone.

Grabowsky","An Excellent Device For Our Kitchen","January 17, 2018","This Echo is an addition to our growing stable of Echos. It started with the original, then came the Tap, followed by the Show. Each of them fits into a different portion of our home. The original is in our bedroom and provides the news as we dress as well as music at other times. The Tap resides in our family room during these winter months, but is our patio and screened porch unit in warmer days. The Show is in the den where we watch TV, read or just hang out. It has become somewhat of our casual entertainment device - music while we read or search the web and answering questions about current, past events or just trivia. We enjoy viewing the occasional movie trailer and family/vacation photos. Then came the Spot. It is a perfect addition to the kitchen and resides on a shelf above the sink. My wife enjoys music while she works and the timer feature which is a convenient addition to the ones in the microwave and the stove. It is particularly useful for some recipes. We have occasionally used the Show and the Spot for calls to our daughter's Echo and cell phone. She lives about five miles from our home. To sum it up. the Spot is perfect for our kitchen. It is the right size, has a reasonable speaker and fits our lifestyle. Next is the workshop?","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I paired her with a TP plug so she turns my light off every night.  Those with kids will appreciate the fact that Alexa obeys immediately,and never talks back or says she’s too busy.

The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!

Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won’t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner.

I have been using Alexa for a while now and using her is kind of second nature to me. Every morning she will read my news that I have selected inform me about the weather and give me all the details that I need to now. And NOW I can drop in and make phone call see my dog or talk to my family if I have to. THIS IS AWESOME

I understand that many media communities have stated that the ""Drop-in"" feature of the Echos is a bit ""creepy"" and I can see their points. However; Here is a different perspective. My Grandmom is now about 95 years old, and she has a short-term memory, she is in high spirits though I really can't teach her anything technical, such as using a phone or pressing a memory dial. So what can she do in an emergency situation or if I need to make sure she takes her medication.

Therefore I say with an extreme gratitude to Amazon that, Thank You Amazon for this for all the time that you have put in to create such a fantastic item and making my Grandmom happy.

I Personally am enjoying all of the other amazing features of an Alexa with an addition of the screen, using her with all my daily need and making my home automated. Amazon Spot is absolutely a quite a fantastic platform. In my house, I have added a Pioneer bookshelf stereo system so that I can be listening to Spotify and Pandora. From now all I have to say is ""Alexa, connect to Bluetooth,"" the stereo Bluetooth will get enabled with that command, the Spot will wake up the Pioneer, and start playing the sound.

THIS IS MAGICAL","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First of all, it was very annoying to not clearly see the time - I had the largest red numbers available. Then, on an illuminated gray background it made it even harder to see the time. I literally had to pick it up and look at it.

Then the issue of snooze. If you say ""Alexa snooze"" it snoozes for 9 minutes - they need another snooze time.

All in all the unit was a bit smaller in physical size than I had anticipated. I feel bummed out that it didn't meet my expectations.
1) Needs to have LARGER numbers.
2) Needs to have the ability to have a solid BLACK clock (night) background (as a choice)
3) Needs snooze options - 9 minutes doesn't cut it for me.

I'm going back to using my old Sony box clock. It may be ugly, but at least I can clearly see the time from wherever I am, day or night.

EDIT: If Echo developers solve these issues I'll be ordering again in a heartbeat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All of the previous reviews have pretty much captured the ups and downs.  I'm here to tell you (and Amazon) what this thing needs to become closer to perfect.

1. A repeating alarm - The Spot needs to allow you to set an alarm for multiple events.  Example: ""Computer, set an alarm for 4AM Monday- Friday.""  Also the ability to turn that saved alarm on or off in case of a day off from work or whatever.

2. 24-Hour Clock display - Some people (like me) just prefer it.  Also would make it more user friendly in some other countries perhaps?

3. Ability to choose your Home screen - I would like my Spot to display the Clock/Weather combo screen all of the time except in night mode.  I stopped the scrolling ""Things to Try"" abomination, but in order to see the info I want I still have to swipe the screen over.

4. More clock face options/font size selections - Make it a little easier to see the time at night or from across the room; without having the menus be oversized for the screen.

5. Battery backup - Alarm clocks are no good with the power out...

6. USB power - Why is this thing not powered by a USB like nearly every other thing on the planet now?  At the very least give me a USB out so I can charge something else from it while this thing sucks up an outlet.

Bonus: A wake up light - Something like the Philips sunrise alarm clock.  A wake up light that gradually increases in brightness as part of your alarm would put this little device over the top for me.  While I'm not naïve enough to believe that the little LCD screen could reproduce that sunrise effect, I think I would still be a beneficial add on for those that like it or may have used it previously.

Overall for me, I like it.  But I'm still in the honeymoon phase as well... We'll see if I stick with it, or go back to my old way and relegate this to be a very expensive Echo Dot somewhere else in the house.

***UPDATE*** I have figured out that once you set an alarm on the Spot, you can go into the app and adjust the alarm settings to recur for weekdays, weekends, etc.  You just can't set the recurrence with voice... yet?","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_84?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=84&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Original post:
Got my spot in December and it was immediate love. Five months later, it’s quit working. Not happy. Not happy with customer service. I was lied to by customer service, first they said it needed thirty minute software update. An hour and forty five minutes later, it still didn’t work. Contacted customer service again. Now they said, oh, yes software updated. I checked. Still has the same number. I made timed screen shots before and after, the same number. They forwarded me to technical person.  I confirmed I had restarted and reset to factory and still it didn’t work. So they are going to send me new device. But not until I mail old one back. Seriously? I will mail tomorrow they will get it at best on Wednesday. They will have to check that it is really broken. That will take a day or two. Then they will mail replacement. That will take another few days to get here, so all told at least a week to replace. Probably longer. And this is the thanks I get after I have purchased at least five echos for my house, given others as gifts, and have encouraged friends and family to join the amazon ecosystem.

If you are familiar with the Show, the Spot is similar, except the smaller size.  The speaker works well for its size.  It makes for a great alarm clock, one that can not only wake you up, but also tell you the morning weather, traffic staus and recent news.  It also works well for Amazon video calling.  For anyone investing in the Amazon ecosystem, I recommend this.  That said, if you are a Youtube watcher, you may want to avoid the FireTV and Echo Show since Youtube is no longer supported.  The Spot is too small to watch Youtube on so lack of it did not volor my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first, I thought this might just be a novelty item of sorts but I quickly found many uses and applications for the Echo. I keep the Echo in my main living area which is quite a distance from my bedroom, and didn't think the Echo Plus would fit on my night stand. So, when I saw the Spot advertised, I immediately saw that this would solve the problem. And it has.

It has all of the functionality that the Echo has and fits easily on the nightstand. It has taken over many of the previous functions of several different products such as alarm clock, sleep aid music player, etc. While I agree that the speaker is not as good as the Echo, it is more than adequate for my purposes. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a very functional, high tech, well thought-out, easy-to-use, bedside or office desk, smart gadget.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the ""Things to try"" screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device. Just a couple of more things to add.  The stand (That little .50 bit of plastic they sell for $20) dosn't come with the unit. Why??? Let the purchaser decide if they want to use it or not.  Lastly there absolutely should be a Physical way to override the camera on ANY product that comes with one. They promote this as an in home/bedroom appliance, you should be able, with absolute conference, be able to know the camera can not see anything.  Yes you can disable the camera in the software, but that can be remotely overridden.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.

**UPDATE** 7/31/18 I was contacted by a member of the review department at Amazon.  He was very polite, present to talk to, and concerned about my low rating of the product.  He was very willing to hear my thoughts, that actually brought up a couple of more issues I had thought of and added above.  He also offered to have their development people speak with me and see if there was something that could be done.  I welcomed that very much.  So we will see if anything actually happens.  I due encourage you all that have purchased this product to submit a well thought out review and express exactly what you like and what you done't. Maybe we can make this a better product","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the bundle with the amazon cloud cam and they work seamlessly together, other amazon cams may need a ""skill"" download but those are easy to take care of. Timer alerts can be hard to hear if you have background noise going on, but i've heard you can set a timer with music so that might solve that. My only complaint and its not that big of a deal but between the radio and the TV i had to change the name to echo instead of Alexa because of all the Alexa commercials. Amazon, it was funny in the beginning but can we get this figured out lol","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_130?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=130&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For some reason, after long monitoring, Ring decides to disconnect so watching the kids approach the door wasn’t quite what it could be, but no complaints. The only latent “quirk” is that when evening comes along, the camera shows in color until a bright light hits it. Then it goes to black and white and stays that way. Not an Echo problem but a Ring software flaw.
Update--4/5/2018 Echo Spot.  I originally gave this a one star since it did not do what it was advertised to do, namely show me my Ring Pro front door camera.  This was the only reason I purchased it.  All it shows is ""Waiting for Ring.com"" with a blurred view of the last thing it had in memory for the front door.  On a hunch, I stayed up late and tried it again. Much to my surprise it worked almost immediately, but showed ""Buffering..."" every other second.  My past experience is that this is a server problem and not a device problem.  I think that the Ring server in Dallas has difficulty communicating with me in Houston, TX.  Since Amazon now owns it all, I presume this will be remedied since Houston is the fourth largest city in the USA and many others will have the same problem.  So far, I like everything about it.  It is very intuitive to use to the point that I have not even watched a YouTube explaining it.  Telephone calls are crisp and sound great on both ends and do not require the other party to have an echo. Amazon---please fix the Ring camera problem!!!  This is a buy recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_157?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=157&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a couple Echo dots and an echo and wanted to be able to use this in my bedroom for broadcasting messages dropping in basically using as an intercom system. So far I've been pretty happy with the spot. I like the fact that it's got a decent speaker in it and that I use it for white noise when I'm sleeping. I found a Babbling Brook sound that really does help me sleep. It's pretty nice the screen the way it darkens automatically when the lights go out. As far as watching anything on it I really haven't done that yet. I haven't used the screen feature much except for it being an alarm clock and adjusting my settings. I do like that you can use pictures that you have stored on your phone as background for the clock face. I get to wake up every morning to a picture of my dog...which kind of irritates the wife but she'll get over it. I would say overall I'm happy with my purchase for the price. A little better selection of the clock face would be nice but I'm sure if I searched the skills I would find something.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Excitement turned to frustration. When I set it up and selected a wallpaper, it had a nice size time centered in the screen. I was so excited. Looked great! Then.............The ""Things to try"" took over. Not only annoying, they dominate the screen and minimize the time to a small area at the top. You can't even see it unless you are close. THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF!!!!!! Unbelievable! I have multiple other Echo devices and I am thoroughly disappointed in this item. The Echo Show has ""Things to try"" also but seeing as it sits on a desk in my kitchen, it's not that annoying. Please, Amazon, allow us to disable this function! I've had Echo products for years and do not need redundant suggestions that I already know about! ""Try asking Alexa for Horse jokes."" Puh-lease!

******Gotta give credit to Amazon Customer Service, they called within hours of posting this review. She was very helpful and understanding but didn't quite ""solve"" my problem but gave me direction to minimize it.
1: Change display to modern setting.
2: Turn off notifs including continuous rotation.
Not ideal, but we'll see how it goes. I'm using as an alarm clock, others might want notifs on. She did state they are pushing developers to rectify this issue. Will update later.

I wanted two primary things out of this device.  First, the ability for it to switch between everyone’s accounts, so everyone could play their own Spotify playlists, and have other account specific services available.  And secondly, I wanted to display the analog clock constantly.  Neither of these needs could be met.  I realized during setup that it can only switch between two adult accounts.  My wife and I thought this was an odd policy, since many families have adult children living at home while attending college, or elderly parents sharing the home.  But in general, these devices really should support an entire family.  Kids/teens want to listen to their own playlists, and have access to their own services.

As for the display, it starts with the analog clock, but then changes to other screens, and I was unable to find any settings to prevent this.  You can set a background, but that’s all.  The round display was mildly annoying during setup, because if your input is too wide (as was our WiFi password), the first and last letters only show half of the characters.  This doesn’t cause any real problems - it’s just a small annoyance that’s worth mentioning.  Additionally, the Alexa app seems to be a little behind in the new device setup area.  It doesn’t even list the Spot as a device to set up.

On the positive side, it sounded fairly loud, and I would agree with other reviewers that it falls somewhere in between the full Echo and the Echo Dot.  We own a Dot already, and this Spot was definitely more rich and full sounding than the Dot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_30?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=30&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It worked good for that at first, but Alexa...Alexa started out great and was pretty helpful at letting me know the time, setting alarms/timers, checking weather, playing music, etc. I don’t ask for much more from it, not interested in the smart home capabilities. As time has gone on though, I find Alexa saying “sorry, I don’t know that one” and “hmm, I’m not sure” more than anything. Nowadays more often than not, I am completely ignored. I don’t ask for more advanced tasks, just “Alexa, wake me up at...” “Alexa, play wave sounds” and a couple of other things. Day after day, Alexa has become more and more incapable. The ai is ruining this device. There is no manual way to set an alarm, you can’t bypass Alexa. I don’t blame the Echo Spot itself for its recent shortcomings. It’s obviously the fault of the people who work specifically on Alexa. Maybe that’s not fair to say, as Alexa is still better than Siri. In the end, if your looking for simple tasks like I was, this might be okay, but I’m wondering if there’s a better device (like a regular alarm clock). But if you’re looking for a good ai, I’d try google.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Spot blew me away. Easy to set up and get connected. The Touch screen menu means you don't need to always use the mobile app to make changes. Integrated microphone with great sound pickup, Speakers that deliver clear sound, LCD screen to display all manner of things and an inbuilt camera to enable video chats.

The auto dimmer works extremely well and is ideal for bedside use. Multiple clock faces to chose from and you can also add a picture as background to the clock face. When appropriate it display information on the screen as well as audio responses to your questions. For example, ask about weather, or your schedule and it also shows the information on the screen. It can also be configured to 'do not disturb' (other than alarm clock) during your sleeping period.

Home control is a breeze and it also enables you to select light controls via the touch screen.

The microphone(s) appear to work at a distance of one foot (not quite as good as the sensitivity of the Echo Dot at perhaps twice that distance).

As a developer, I find that the APIs for the Echo Show don't gracefully ""just work"" as expected on the Echo Spot. Amazon's changed the layout in such a way that the Spot won't show an incoming image, for example. Presumably there is a different layout required in the programming but since the product is so new, there are no examples yet so it's a little problematic in the coding space for this.

It does seem to work in a number of capacities. It feels like Amazon's grand design would be to empower (""enable"") us to be constant consumers so it appears that much attention was placed on making this Amazon.com-friendly. I encourage owners to immediately turn off the ability to purchase by voice; the Alexa interface can easily hear ""what is the starting time for the new Iron Man movie?"" and it respond with ""okay, I've made a purchase for seven books on Amazon.com and they should arrive soon"".

The screen is good for things like my camera system for outside or my “ring door bell” to see who’s at my door and be able to talk to them.

I don’t use as an alarm clock and amazon has come out with a shell you can put on spot to cover the camera that pretty cool. Like others on here and I have read many reviews and the countless requests for the THINGS TO TRY BANNER to go away and amazon has done nothing about that and that disappoints me, plus if you are going to put a screen on your device give it more uses.

I still argue the point that Alexa needs a platform to work off like google home, but i do love the skills you just have to find the right one and remember the ones you put on the device.

Over all it’s just an over priced dot, with a few tricks since it has a screen, will probably return then until amazon comes out with a better use form them, until then LOVE my dots and will continue to use them.

One more thing for people that are only apple users, I have to say I do like Siri better then Alexa. Siri is more personable and remembers thing better the Alexa, she still kind of cold!!! lol","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This product seems so sold.  The screen is beautiful.  It feels very premium.  Also, over time the App that coordinates all this is getting better and better.  I also have google devices but really dont use them any more as part of the appeal is once these are everywhere they expand in value.  I really like the visual interface, it is simple, pleasing, and relaxing.  Having a visual along with the spoken makes things stick longer in my mind.  The one thing  is the add in the scroll that cannot be turned off unless you turn off the scroll.  However I get adds on my kndles and I dont care after a while.  Especially since I know that it brings down the cost.  The cost of this unit is not the unit but the sever farms and bandwith that you dont see processing your requests.  There is no subscription with any of this yet it gets better and better.  My house  has an intercom, synchronized music, timers telling my kids get ready for bed that trigger at different time in different rooms, a sub woofer in my living room,  5  named tirmers running at once when I'm cooking, on and on, and I paid maybe $500 for all this?  Everyone who is complaining about suggested apps is missing the bigger picture, and has become spoiled to some degree.  I paid $99 for this device, seems more than reasonable.

F.","Already having a couple of Echo Dots, I find the Spot to be an improvement, if only for the display.","April 29, 2018","Setup of the Spot was simple.  I use it as a bedroom alarm clock, and I like the features.  You can select from several different clock face displays.  This display automatically dims at night, but that feature can be modified in the settings function, along with many other parameters.  The display also randomly lists different suggestions for the device's use, which is helpful.  The flash briefings do contain some video.  I'm a fan of talk radio, so mostly I use it at different times, along with the Dots, to listen to various stations.  The sound quality for that use is surprisingly good.  Frankly, while I think that these devices are fun, I don't find them particularly useful for me, but that may be partly my own lack of interest in trying to learn all of which they may be capable.  I'm in my sixties....  I did buy a smart switch and use the Dot/Spot to turn a lamp on and off.  It works fine, but I'd rather just use the switch.  I guess I could go crazy and get wifi smart door locks, thermostats and whatever else is available, but as the saying goes, you can't teach an old horse new tricks.  Still, these devices can be fun to explore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_290?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=290&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Just a word of warning though — I really liked the idea of having the time/temp/weather always visible, like in the display. That was one of the main reasons why I purchased the Spot. But that is not an option. You can set the display for time only. Or you can set the display to scan between several screens, the one in the picture being one of the screens.

I received 4 ""spots"" less than 24 hours ago and 3 are set up; one in my room, one in the living room, and one in the kitchen.  The 4th will be in dad's room once I have learned what it can and can't do and how to do it.  The lack of available information so I can learn is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  Alexa can't answer questions about what she can or cannot do.  She can't answer questions about her own features.  For example, I asked her what the ""remote"" function was for on her own set up menu.  Her response resembled this:  ""huh, duh, what"".  Annoying.  I asked Alexa if she could search the web for me and I got the same response.  Alexa's ""self-awareness"" is pretty much non-existent.

I incorrectly assumed I would be able to ""drop in"" to make sure my dad is safe.  However, you can't use the camera to see a room, or as a nanny cam.  It is meant for web content and closeups of faces.  I just ordered 3 Wyze Cam Pan 1080p's (I don't need one for my bedroom).  The Wyze Cam is advertised to work with the spot.  If I can't immediately access video of my dad using Alexa Spot I honestly don't think I will keep it.  I got the spots because my hands are busy with things like cooking, laundry, etc. etc.  I thought I would be able to tell Alexa ""drop in on the living room"" and I could look over at the spot and check on dad as opposed to dropping what I'm doing and physically going into the other room -- mind you dad rarely sleeps in his bed.  His sleep habits are not habits, they are unpredictable.

I will update after I get the cams and let other caregivers know if it's working and, if pertinent, where to find the information to get it to work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I recently downloaded audio books as well so if I want to listen to those, I can. In the morning I can watch a few videos from bed before getting up. I video call my husband to talk to him a few minutes on his way to work.  It can turn up loud enough to hear it in the master bath so I’ll tell her to play upbeat music while I’m in the shower! I’ll be ordering a smart plug so I can tell Alexa to turn my light off if I’m too comfortable to do it myself because sometimes if I just move a little while falling asleep, I’ll pop up, wide awake and can’t get comfortable again.

Easy peesy set up - I was able to get it up and running and customized in less than 20 minutes - score!!!
Paired my bluetooth Thonet and Vander speakers (that also live with my bedroom TV) flawlessly. Figured out how to set recurring and different alarms for weekdays and weekends (after you set the 'single alarm' go to the alexa app under alarms and reminders - you have far more control through the app to easily change that single alarm into a recurring alarm with lots of options). Got a photo uploaded to make a custom clock face (used my photo cloud storage at Prime). Played some Prime music. Watched a little CNN. What isn't to love???

THE FONT SIZE!!!!!

It can't be that hard to give us options on font size on the 'personalized' clock. Hey, Amazon developers, not all of us have perfect eyesight, especially at night when the eyeglasses end up on the night stand next to the Spot. Listen to the nearsighted of America, heck, the World, give us a bigger font!!!!!

As soon as Amazon addresses this 'you gotta be kidding' fix, I will be changing that 4 star review to a 5!!!

Edit:
They listened!!!
There is now a much bigger font, very similar to what I photoshopped in my ‘wish’ photo, and it can turn red at night. A++ and I changed my rating to five stars. I really like this little spot, we have been buying more Alexa compatible items and our ‘smart home’ is really coming together.

And for all of my ‘commentors’ who suggested just asking Alexa what time it is, I would rather not wake up my guy in the middle of the night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The Spot serves the function I bought it for - it let’s me “drop in” on my dad, for whom I bought an Echo Show. When I got the Spot and the Show at Best Buy, both were $129. The Echo Show is in almost constant use by my dad, who LOVES his music. I opted for the Spot instead of the show for myself due to bedside size constraints. I ended up buying everyone else in my family Echo Shows after I saw how much easier it was for my dad to use than his phone nowadays. But for me, the Spot is all I need.

I keep the camera covered and I try not to have conversations around it. But I’m happy to use it as an alarm clock, timer, music machine and quiz mate. I’m not expecting it to take the place of my phone, but given how reliant my family members are on their Echo Shows, I’m glad that I can use my Spot to interact.

I get how people who wanted it more as a home assistant are less than impressed - it is small, and there aren’t as many features as the Show. Also, there are quirks that were bad enough to make me deduct a star - specifically, the “Alexa Billboard” that pops up and the fact that having Alexa devices in the same Prime household - regardless of separate Amazon accounts and forms of payment - Alexa “merges” our calendar entries, so everything from my calendar shows up in my father’s Show as well as my Spot. That bugs me.

That said, it’s a valued tool for me. I’m not dependent on it, but it has improved my life in many different ways. If you don’t like the small size, just get a Show. But if you don’t really care what the screen is doing, this is a perfect addition for random tasks and functions. Worth it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Addition To The Family (Dec. 28, 2017 update)","December 24, 2017","SHORT & SWEET: If your bedside table has a clock radio and an old-fashioned phone, this is the perfect replacement or, at $130, would have been about 5 years ago. For 2018, it's an adorable but overpriced replacement that should have some kind of battery backup.  OTOH we've had it for only a few hours so ...

(I've updated the Setup section - 12/28/2017)

BACKGROUND:

It started with a Generation I Echo in the bedroom, to be used mainly as a clock radio with voice input. As a radio, it was pretty good. As an alarm clock, rather annoying.  (Really, when you wake up do you honestly want to *tell* your Echo to shut up?) But we got a second Echo (also Generation I but at a reduced price) for the living room. Meanwhile, upstairs, we got tired of moving the main bedroom Echo into the guest bedroom while cleaning. (I mean, we had to unplug it, carry it half a dozen steps, plug it in, let it wake up.) So we recently got a Generation II Echo for that room. Not just for convenience, of course. We figured visiting family and friends deserved a better ""radio"".

We needed another Echo like the proverbial hole in the head. So, why did we buy the Spot? Well, we convinced ourselves that it would be quite a nice addition to the kitchen, even though said kitchen is but 3 steps from the ""living room"" Echo (albeit around a small corner). That Echo's location was selected precisely because it was between the kitchen and the living room, but it also meant putting the Echo very near the TV and, sad to say, Alexa appears to like the voices of those on the tele better than ours. So we convinced ourselves that if we had a ""kitchen"" Echo we could move the ""living room"" Echo to a more central spot, where Alexa might be more amenable to responding to us.

Also, let's face it , the Echo Spot is cute.

REVIEW

NOTE: We are not exactly Amazon's target Echo family. We own no smart devices, other than the TVs. We don't use the Echos for lists or for shopping. They remain, basically, enhanced - but overpriced - combo clock radios/timers/calculators*.

Delivery Oddities

When we ordered the White Spot, we were given a delivery date of Dec. 19, 2017 - which is when buyers of the Black Spot (based on the early reviews) seem to have received theirs. Then we got an email informing us of a Jan. 10, 2018 delivery date. A few days later, the delivery date was changed to Dec. 27, 2017.  Then we woke up on Dec. 24, 2017 to find it sitting by the front door.  Not complaining mind you, but others have speculated about the Spot being shipped before it was fully ""cooked"" and I wonder if these changing delivery dates are signs they may be right.

SET-UP

Each generation of Echo seems to come with fewer written instructions, as if Amazon assumes everybody is already familiar with Alexa on some device (other Echo or tablet) or as if the Echos had become self-explanatory.

Is set-up easy for a newbie? For the most part, yes, but I'm not sure it would have been quite so easy if I had not read some of the reviews first. The instructions in the box are minimal, the most useful being that you need to know the password for your Wi-Fi. After plugging it in, we were greeted in German(!) but the screen display let us change the default language to English. Then you must enter the password for the Wi-Fi network you want to use. Alexa then informs you it will take about 10 minutes (which seemed fairly accurate) to download and install itself. The screen shows progress via a light bar circling around and status (updating, optimizing, checking for latest software).  Once it has finished, you'll see a brief intro video telling you all the wonderful things you can do.

It's at this point that I think several reviewers ran into trouble. What to do next? I'm not sure I would have known to swipe down from the top for settings without having known about it beforehand (even though I own 5 Fires and should know that by now). I suspect that the proverbial grandmother who is unfamiliar with touch devices might not have known when to touch, swipe, or press the check mark. These are, I think, relatively minor issues that could have been solved with either a few more written instructions (the booklet is so small many probably missed the 3rd ""page"" with the ""instructions"" about pulling down from the top) or a much better introductory video.

One example: changing the clock face. It had seemed to me that I could only choose analog or digital, not that I could change the clock theme (and there was no visible feedback when I selected digital). So I asked Alexa and she told me how to do it. The Spot still doesn't have a lot of theme choices but I'm guessing that will change in the future. (Oh, you can get rid of Trending Issues and cycling. Our Spot has a simple clock that dims when the lights are out and brightens up when the lights are on.)

12/28/2017 Update: There aren't a lot of options with the Echo Spot but after several problems setting up the theme background (choosing ""Personal Photo"" works only about 1% of the time) I want, and after reading a number of complaints, I reviewed the tiny booklet that comes with Spot and then went to Amazon's help section and looked at ""all"" the videos for the Spot. Note: Amazon, for the most part, doesn't even distinguish between the Show and the Spot. The videos are inadequate. To say the least. Some of the issues with setting up the Spot could be resolved by adding check boxes to the options rather than relying on touch or Alexa. But Amazon could probably solve most of its help desk issues by creating a simple text document that shows each Spot screen with the options and sub-options available so new users don't have to keep cycling through stuff trying to find what they want.

FUNCTIONALITY

The Spot is sort of a smaller Show or a bigger (and cuter) Dot with a screen. The speaker is surprisingly good for such a small device, although I doubt you would want to listen to opera on it (unless you attach a Bluetooth speaker). The screen is less than ideal for video (not so much because it is small as because it is round). But we've found the screen display of our music makes it easier to choose something than with the other Echos which rely on voice.

Our main reason for choosing the kitchen as the Spot's home was the idea that its screen would help with recipes. So, naturally, we thought ""YouTube"".  Unfortunately, whether because of device limitations or Amazon's current (Dec. 2017) feud with Google, YouTube is not available. Nevertheless, we were able to get several recipes simply by asking and YouTube doesn't have a monopoly on videos.

WAKE WORD

Well, having established Spot in the kitchen, we moved the ""living room"" Echo away from the TV and kitchen. And, guess what? Yep, both Spot and the ""living room"" Echo responded when we addressed Spot. So we changed Spot's wake word to ""Echo"".  Now we have 3 Echos that respond to ""Alexa"" and one that responds to ""Echo"" plus our tablets which respond to ""Amazon"".

I understand the logic behind having a single command word for all of one's devices, but there are circumstances where one wants to interact with only one specific device, whether it is near to one or somewhat distant. So, Amazon, if you're reading these reviews, a suggestion. First, we want to call Spot ""Spot"".  It fits. Second, how about a command hierarchy which would, for example, let us give a unique call word to each Echo with ""Alexa"" or ""Alexa All"" being the ""all devices respond"" command word. I haven't completely thought through how this would work, but device proximity isn't sufficiently discriminatory.

SUMMARY

1. Full Echo functionality in a tiny, good-looking package.

2. As currently designed, its most useful spot is probably the bedside table. It's not that it won't work on your desk or in the kitchen, only that the primary functions (alarm, weather, radio, phone) seem best suited for that location.

3. It's over-priced for what it does, but I am assuming the price will drop so I consider this simply an early-adopter issue.

4. Each of our Echos gets its electricity via an extension cord of some kind. Between the power cord's length and the AC adapter brick, well, either our apartment is remarkably deficient in electrical outlets or Amazon engineers have them spaced at table height at 3-foot intervals. This hadn't been more than a trivial annoyance (common to lots of electronic devices) until we decided to put Spot in the kitchen: the most useful locations were already in use by the microwave, toaster oven and mixer.  The one spot available doesn't affect its usefulness as a radio or clock or timer but does as a recipe aid.

5. Spot needs a battery. Desperately. By your bedside, you want your alarm clock/radio to work even when the electricity goes out at 4AM. (Which also means, of course, that some basic functionality shouldn't depend on Wi-Fi). In the kitchen, it would be great to be able to pick the Spot up and move it to wherever you are working. in addition, the most comfortable way to use Spot's touch functions is to pick him up and hold him in your hand. Doing this is not all that easy when the power cord is stretched to its limit ...  which is yet another reason why a well-designed battery base would be welcome.

If there are engineering reasons why Spot can't have a small internal battery, battery power could be built into a small base or stand. (I think some vendors have offered them for at least the Generation I Echos.) This would be useful especially IF Spot's alarm clock & radio functions weren't dependent on WiFi. (Maybe Amazon has heard of FM receivers?)

I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but decided that giving it 4 stars because it's adorable to look at was, well, somehow not professional, and, of course, there's the price. Spot's a nice addition to the Echo line with potential, either in its current implementation or in its next incarnation.

------------
*Oh, we still have real radios, timers and calculators in every room. None are dependent on the wi-fi working and most either run on batteries or have battery backup so they're useful even when the lights go out. So, yes, the Echos do rank as perhaps our most frivolous fourth-world purchases ever. But we wouldn't give them up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_296?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=296&reviewerType=all_reviews"

All of the networks I attempted to use for the setup had other devices (including 2 Echo's and an Echo Dot) connected to them but this device would not connect.  I wasted over an hour on the phone with an Amazon Help Desk person who was no help at all and was clearly following a script.

You want to have control over a product you purchased and turn off “Things to try”?  Well, according to Amazon, too bad.  You’ll get that on rotation (without any pre-purchase disclaimer) whether you want it (who would?!?) or not (I do not!!)

The bad:
Already mentioned above, you get what Amazin wants you to have the way they want you to get it, period.
Alexa software = crap.  Worst UI since Phillips! Not user friendly in the least.
Would you like to learn more about “Things to try”, good because you will be seeing a lot of it on this device, don’t like it? Sucks to be you (yeah, I’m hammering home this point)
Speaker, better than the dot but could have been a lot better for the price range

The good:
Alexa voice controls responsive
Plays music
Good alarm features
Easy to see in dark or fully lit room

Bottom line: avoid this product at all costs.

If you get one as a gift this year, I’d strongly recommend sending it back.
Don’t purchase this until Amazon learns that we’re buying devices for OUR use, not to make their sales jobs easier.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I needed a replacement for my dying clock radio, and it frees up space on my bedside table, so I count that as a win. It also replaces a 1st generation Echo (which I've moved elsewhere), which I used for music, weather, and alarms/timers.

The setup was quick and easy, though it took me a while to figure out how to turn off the annoying time/weather/try-this scrolling. There isn't a great selection of clock-face choices, but I'm happy with the one I picked....and really.....I just need to know what time it is (I use the digital display). As other reviewers have noted, the sound quality isn't as good as the old Echo, but based on its size, I wasn't expecting that it would be. I suppose I could always connect it to a better speaker via Bluetooth, but I haven't tried that yet. After having it for a few days, I did decide to buy the stand (sold separately.....Grrrrr), since it makes for a better viewing angle, and slightly better sound quality (since it's not sitting directly on the table surface). I've opted to turn off a few features, e.g., the camera, which I probably will never use.

There are a couple of items I'd change: 1) it would be nice to be able to have the time display in a larger font, so I could see it without needing my glasses, 2) after starting to play your music selection, it stays in 'music,' and you have to either tell it to go back to 'home,' or touch the display and select the 'home' icon. Perhaps these capabilities will arrive in a future software update...or perhaps I haven't dug deeply enough into the settings menu yet....

However, despite its cost, I'm extremely happy with my Spot, and would recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Every time you ask her to do or change anything, she tells you to go to the App on your phone to do it.  So I have an voice recognition assistant that tells me to ""Go do it yourself!"".  Tell her to Don't ever play any Ed Sheeran, and she says ""I don't know any Ed Sheeran.""  I pay for I Heart Radio, and Alexa won't play my Playlists or Albums, only stations, and gives me limited skips, as if I have a free account.  I set IHR as my default, but unless I tell her to play something on IHR, she defaults to Amazon Music.  I have 3 Alexa items in the house, but to be able to listen to different music on each I had to pay more for an upgraded music account.  IHR I can play different music on all three devices, but have to be specific, and its limited.
My 4k Samsung Smart TV, PS4 and Satellite receiver all work well together, they can turn each other on and off, they play games together, but Alexa doesn't play well with them, and all the add-ons to try to get the TV to work are sketchy looking.
Tried to set up Voice recognition for my kids, but couldn't figure out how to get it to work, mostly it kept sending me to add another adult account.  I called customer support and spoke to a man who didn't speak enough English to understand what I was asking help with.  Spent most of the time on hold, every time I asked a question he would say just one moment, then ten minutes later would comeback with a vague answer, that wasn't really about what I was asking.  After 40 or so minutes, the best I got was 'I don't think it can do that.""
Most of the Apps are just Gimmicky junk, I haven't found anything all that useful, unless you want some pre-programmed goofy responses, or play some dumb games.

Then I started playing around, setting both timers and alarms , which never went off. The timer would accurately keep the countdown if you asked, but not make a peep when the alarm expired. Every time I set the alarm, asked what time I set it for I would get the 'The Alarm is set for...""(no time). It was more like ""The alarm is seh for..."" It sounded truncated and weird.

(theres nothing on this issue that I could find on the internet btw) After the SECOND factory reset, the alarm works. As it always has on my Echo Dot.

I think it is idea for my bathroom. The speaker is on the bottom and the spot does sound better when the speaker is not directly on the countertop. It will sound even better with the Spot stand. The only down side, the Spot stand should be included. It should not be an additional $19. Well, after using my Amazon Spot for five months my device does not always respond to me. So, still was not wanting to spend $20 on the Spot stand. I decided to do a DIY stand. It works better.

Shamford","Great first Echo with a few limitations","January 8, 2018","I have spent about 3 weeks with this now and I really enjoy it so far. The Spot is not perfect, the screen is round but most content is square, there is less home screen customization than I would hope for and there are still limitations on what it can do. I suggest checking out IFTTT to add functionality to your Alexa by connecting with other apps you may already use. For example, I linked my Alexa todos with my Apple ical calendar which isn't available directly from the Amazon software.

I keep the Spot in my kitchen to entertain me while I cook with music and news. It does the basics really well, though you can't ask questions with any complexity. I like that if I ask for something that is covered by a skill I don't have I have the option to download it on the spot. For example, I asked for a TED talk and it downloaded the TED skill so I could ask for various talks in the future. The sound quality is good enough to fill a large kitchen or kitchen and living room even, but not good enough for a party or really rocking out.

All in all, I am happy with this device and it is WAY better than Siri on my phone. I think there are several features I am not yet aware of that will also add to my enjoyment in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_277?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=277&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve had an Echo Dot for a year","February 21, 2018","What’s not to love? I’ve had an Echo Dot for a year, but the Spot surpasses it in every way! I wanted a second Alexa device and couldn’t decide between this or another Dot. At first I didn’t think a screen would be such a huge difference to justify the extra cost, but I was very wrong. I bought two of them and one is in my bedroom and one is in my kitchen. The Spot will do everything your non-screen Alexa devices will do plus the following, which for me justify the extra cost of the screen for me:
LISTS: You can create your own lists and add items on both by saying “add passport to my packing list”, but on the Spot it will show you the whole list on the screen after adding it. You can also ask the Spot “show me my packing list” to see entire list on screen, where you can delete directly from screen, as in after you packed passport.
REMINDERS: When you add a reminder (like remind me to take out trash at 7am), the Dot will chime & state the reminder only once at 7am, but if you’re not around to hear it you’ll miss it. After adding a reminder to your Spot, it will chime the same as the Dot at the right time but if you are not there to hear it, a visual reminder stays on the screen until you dismiss it by either saying the word “dismiss” or you swipe up on the screen.
TIMERS: Much better than the Dot, especially for kitchen because you can add multiple timers and see all timers in motion all at once. Same as alarms and reminders, you can say “dismiss” or swipe screen up.
ALARMS: It’s easy to see if alarms are set or not just by looking at the screen as it shows up on home clock. You can also set multiple alarms, weekday or weekend, etc. I would never rely on the Dot for an alarm without feeling like I had to check the App on my phone many times to confirm alarm was set. Not anymore as it’s visible on the main screen.
TRACKING AMAZON PACKAGES: When you ask “where’s my stuff?”, both the Dot & Spot will say where your Amazon package is but the Spot will show you pictures of the items you ordered on the screen.
FLASH BRIEFING: I haven’t found many Video flash briefings to love yet except for Jimmy Fallon’s monologue and even though the screen’s small, it’s still watchable.
HOME SCREEN: Many reviews complain that the Spot won’t stay on the clock face, that it continually cycles through a few screens. There is an option to make it only cycle through your home cards (clock, weather, reminders, etc) once and then it stays on the clock until you wake it up. I chose the analog clock and can read it from any distance while in the room.
MUSIC: I have Amazon Prime so can access all music with Prime. The cool feature on the Spot is that it will show the artist or album cover and then show the lyrics as you hear them, your very own Karaoke machine. Another difference on the Spot is regarding choosing music to play. You can say “show me albums by Coldplay” and it will bring up 16 albums that you can swipe to see all albums and pick the one you want. You can also do the same with playlists if you’ve made them.
VIDEOS: Not sure I would ever watch a movie/tv show I’ve never seen before on such a little screen, but it’s great to have on in background while doing other things. While cleaning kitchen I can re-watch The Newsroom or Suits and the Spot is much louder than my iPad or laptop and I can even hear it while washing dishes. It’s the same process as finding music to play. When you say, “show me all episodes of The Newsroom Season 1”, the Spot will then show you each episode on a separate screen so you just scroll to choose which one to watch.
JEOPARDY: Same game as played on the Dot, but the Spot will show you the answer as well (Eye of the Tiger)
OVERALL: Love it! If you are already familiar with Alexa devices, I can’t imagine you won’t love this Echo Spot!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just set this up today. This is my 5th Echo device but my first device with a video screen. I bought the ""spot"" (vs the show) for a couple reasons.

1. I feel like Amazon is going to be coming out with a 2nd gen ""show"" very soon and I don't want to spend $230 only to have my show be outdated in 6 months.
2. The ""spot"" is new and its generation life should last at least 18-24 months

I wanted a video screen Echo to use in our home office as a baby monitor. We currently use an Amcrest camera and our iPhones and Ipads to video monitor the babies room. While it works great it has the downside of using your phone battery up and the feed shuts down during phone calls. When I read that Alexa devices support Amcrest cameras I thought I wanted to give it a try.

Setup was easy except for 1 small kink. The camera firmware needed to be updated. Now this is not a review on Amcrest cameras so I won't go into details but it did extend my setup time by about 30 minutes. The basic setup through the Amcrest cloud app and the Alexa App was quite easy.
Very self explanatory for those that have delved into Amcrest cameras and Alexa previsouly

The screen is very nice. You can find the specs yourself but I'll say that to the eye it looks crisp clear and bright (unlike our last Amazon screen device the Fire HD 8 6th gen)

This sits on our home office desk and a quick ""Alexa show me babies camera"" and 5 seconds later we are up and running. The camera we are using is currently only 720p but with such a small screen it looks great. I'm curious to see how our 2k and 4k cameras would look on the Echo Show.
The integration with the Amcrest cloud is smooth but limited. What I mean is they give you access to ONE camera only for free. If you want more it will cost you a monthly service fee. I won't get into what you get for the money but I'll link their website incase you would like to see it yourself.

Yes I know there are options available for less money that can handle the baby monitor setup I just made with the Echo spot. However we wanted an Alexa in the office anyway and we already had the Amcrest camera in the baby room so it just made sense in our situation.

Setting this Echo up with the camera connection has me thinking about using it on all the security cameras. It would be great when there's a bump in the night (which we have had a couple times) to be able to say ""Alexa show me security cameras"" and have all of our camera feeds display on the bedroom TV or on an Echo show type device at the bedside. Currelty we need to grab the phone, enter passcode, open the Amcrest app, then open the cameras you want to see. It doesn't seem like much... BUT, When you wake up out of a deep sleep by a loud crash and glass breaking down stairs (yes this happen to us twice) every little thing you do seems to take FOREVER! Not only that but you are multitasking, you want to get the phone ready to call the police if needed, you've gotta open the safe and grab your weapon, open the security cameras, all while half asleep in the dark with blurry vision (or almost blind if you are my wife who has 20/400 vision).

That scenario could be in the future but for right now we are happy with our single Amcrest camera connection to Alexa and the spot itself works great in this case.

The reason for only four stars is the terrible speaker. Presumably you will buy the ""Spot"" to watch video of some kind. Video chat, news updates, streaming a local camera feed.... with all these things you'll need sound or at least want sound. I don't ding the DOT for poor sound because I use it for the microphone only basically. Home control ect. I do use 1 DOT for music but I have it connected to a JBL Pulse 3 external speaker. But the ""Spot"" is used differently as stated. Now I wanted to get the ""Show"" at first because of the larger screen and I read that the speakers are bigger and better. But as I stated already I went with the ""Spot"" for now. The speaker is basically garbage. I'm guessing its the same speaker as the ""Dot"" although I didn't bother to confirm that. If you have the ""Dot"" already you'll know what to expect for sound with the ""Spot""","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen is easy to read especially in night mode which keeps the room dark but still displays time.  I'm able to control my zwave switches and lights, as well as check the weather as I wake up. I love this thing. Everything's been going great for a month of use until this morning at 2AM.

So, apparently every single process this device makes is in the cloud. At about 2AM I woke to see the clock wasn't in its normal night mode, but in regular bright mode and the time says 6:50. After a short but intense panic attack I realize that the clock is simply wrong. The clock remained at the 6 o'clock hour, cycling through the minutes but never advancing an hour.  It went back to 6:00 after rolling over 6:59. This happened on 11/27/2018.

Is there any chance we can suggest that the clock function be processed at home in the device? Failing to display the correct time due to a disconnect seems....well...it seems like a glaring issues that can be easily fixed. I'm assuming my router has finally given out as it does every 2 years which has been the cause of the problems. This gives me great pause in relying on this clock for anything other than a time display. I'm not sure I'll ever trust it for an alarm.

The way I remedied the problem was by changing the access point to which the Spot connects. Definitely a connection problem causing issues a connection problem has no business causing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amazing potential here","December 21, 2017","This is a cool new addition to the echo family and about the size of a softball. I have had other echo products including multiple Dots and a first-generation Echo and I'd consider this a mid-tier device that’s better than a Dot but below a regular Echo (I know this has a lot more features with the screen but I’ll get to that later in the review). I am relating this to other echo devices for comparison purposes, but the screen could make this it's own category of device. I’m constantly finding new features and will update this review periodically (especially as new screen features become available). Overall, I’m impressed with my initial experience of the Spot and more excited for the potential... but IF developers don’t come through this could be a big letdown.

Audio - I am impressed with the audio quality of this and would put it closer to the Echo than the Dot. When playing music, you can quickly tell that the Spot was designed as a standalone audio device (which we know was not the case initially with the Dot). The Spot will never sound as good as an Echo but you can tell thought was put into the sound quality to enhance the experience while trying to keep the footprint as small as possible. The speaker is bigger than the Dot and music doesn’t sound drowned out like it does on the Dot. Obviously, they are not fitting a subwoofer in this tiny package so it won’t have the range of an Echo, but I don’t think that was ever the expectation. If you are only looking for audio quality this wouldn't be your go-to product to begin with.

Alexa – This device uses the enhanced version of far field voice technology and seems to pick up the wake word much easier than my first-gen Echo or any of the Dots. There are 4 microphones on the top of the Spot to pick up your wake word.I feel that I don’t have to yell like is needed sometimes with the older echo products.

Display - I haven’t seen any glitches or had any trouble with the display yet. The screen is a good size and I feel that if it were any bigger it’d feel too bulky. The whole device is about the size of a softball. My only minor complaint about the screen is the shape. I’m a bit torn on this complaint because I do like the uniqueness of it when I have the clock face displayed, but when looking at a news clip or camera the picture shrinks to fit the widescreen display into a circular screen. Not that it’s bad, but it’s just different from other display screen we use day to day.

New Features – The biggest selling point of the Spot to me is the screen and all the possibilities of features that come along with it. I have never used a EchoShow so I can’t compare this to that, but from feedback I've seen I don’t think the Show caught on as much as Amazon had hoped, so I think this will be a cost-effective introduction to most people to an Echo with a screen. There are infinite possibilities of things to do now that Alexa has a display and I am finding new features each time I play with the device.  There are honestly too many features to go through, but I personally use this on my nightstand as my new alarm clock and can see the time, make video calls, ect… The POSSIBLE uses are endless and I’m excited to see what new features will be available going forward. My only complaint about the features is that there are not enough yet. I know the idea of a screen on an Alexa device is new but I had hoped for more things to do out of the box. Skills need to be added through the Alexa app on a phone or computer, which just feels unnecessary. Hopefully updates will allow skills to be added directly from the device.

Overall – I am impressed with the Spot. I feel that there is a lot of potential for this, but just think developers haven't had the time to come up with the world changing ideas yet. The footprint is small and the sound quality good. The screen is a good size, clear, and bright. I would recommend this to anyone with the disclaimer that it should get better with updates and new skills.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_154?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=154&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you are not experienced user of an Alexa product, you may receive this product and be disappointed. I have multiple Alexa devices, Echo(s), Dot, Connect. When I ordered the Echo Spot I knew what it was capable of. I have not been disappointed. The hardware is well done, the sound quality is better than a Dot and the AI is what was expected. The Echo Spot is heavy and stays in place on my night stand. I have a Connect as part of my home phone system. When someone calls in early morning, the Echo Spot announces the call and I can answer the call. The screen is crisp, colorful and displays information from multiple souces.

I have read in other reviews that sleepers were troubled by the Spot's bright light. The spot does adjust for night conditions. In addition to that adjustment, you can go into settings and manually reduce the brightness which will further reduce the light at night.

I was not disappointed with this device's performance and quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_34?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=34&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It seems as though you can video conference with friends and family, maintain shopping lists, get random trivia information, listen to streaming music, even watch videos (via amazon prime).  BUT, you cannot set up any of these features except by using a smartphone.  Correct, once you have registered your device with your account, and now have access to an alexa config page on your amazon account, you cannot do anything useful with it unless you use a smartphone with the alexa app.  Mind you, as dumb as this is, it gets worse.  You can only use the alexa app on smartphones produces within the last year or two.  Android 8.2 or newer, for instance.  So if you want to buy these in order to video-chat with your parents, or your grandparents, they better be technofiles or you just bought them a really expensive alarm clock.
This is the perfect example of where the ""Minimum Viable Product"" design paradigm fails completely.  IF, and only IF, amazon updates their alexa config page so that you can actually configure the device - to make phone calls, for instance - this is one product to avoid.

That being said, the device has a lot of potential, and once that potential is realized, this should be an awesome device.

UPDATE: Amazon contacted me after posting this to let me know that users can now use the alexa app on android 5 or better, which is great for people with older phones.  You still can't add contacts to your device manually (I don't want alexa to have my work contact information, for example), but they are making progress.  The alexa page on my amazon account has been improved as well.  +1","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When it plays music the lyrics are on the screen which is super cool and you can turn the volume up/down from wherever you are by asking alexa to.

It’s a very nice addition to my bedroom.  The sound is good, not as good as the Echo, but better than the dot.  For the size and money- a plus.  The main feature I use it for is the alarm. The issue I have is the snooze option.  You can tap the top of the screen, but BE CAREFUL!  The very top of the device is a mute button.  If you put your hand on the top of the spot to tap the top of the screen, you’ll mute all future alarms.  (Happened to me more than once). Also, about 30% if the time when I say “Echo snooze” she hears “Echo news” and begins telling me the news.  At that point there’s no way to get her to go back to the alarm to snooze it and I’m awake yelling several different commands.  I have it 2 stars because the main purpose of this devise has several flaws for those of us who want a few extra minutes of shut eye.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Alexa is very smart and easy to speak to but she has a few bugs. For example if I say a command during Do Not Disturb it overrides that mode and then I have to reset it. If I enable the explicit music filter, it resets to disable the filter after a few minutes. I also wish all the clock faces have a digital option. I can also play music without having to subscribe to Prime Music Unlimited since I already have Prime Music.

It scared the heck out of me and woke me up instantly. It turns out that when I lazily said ""Alexa, set alarm for 6:45am to Today's Hits"" she heard, ""Alexa, set alarm for 6:45am to Kid's Hits"" so she woke me up with a song by Elmo where he started talking before he started singing. That freaky experience aside, I am really happy with the Echo Spot as my new alarm clock. 98% of the time Alexa understands what I'm asking for when I set an alarm, timer, etc. Other benefits include listening to Audibles or sleep sounds with a sleep timer set after I have Alexa turn off the lights, having Alexa give me my daily report on weather, traffic, news, and sports every morning that I wake up (and even turning on the lights to mirror the outside sun as it gets closer to my alarm), waking up to personally selected music, playing Head's Up and Yes Sire, etc. It's basically the smartest alarm clock I have ever had and I am taking full advantage of it thanks to Prime Day!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_29?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=29&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then I saw the debut of the Spot and it was love at first sight. This one device gave me a clock, radio, voice control of my smart devices ( Nest, lights, alarm, locks), video and voice calling, and access to a host of skill sets that I didn’t know I needed till I started using them ( Headspace to name one). Plus, I love the whole house feature that lets me play the same music in each room that houses an Echo. Members of my family have fallen in love with this cute little orb and have gotten their own. Grateful to other reviews that have offered ideas to personalize the Spot to my needs and improve functionality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The missing star is a lost star for value- at only $20 less than the echo show, the debut price point is disappointing. I was tempted to just order another show in place of this, strictly due to the value factor... larger screen, more sound, more utilities, but this spot does fit its current application much better on a nightstand. Amazon you dirty dog, you knew we couldn't resist.

Google ""smart video alarm clock"", there are much cheaper alternatives out there... but if you're an echo fan, perhaps hold out until summer or next fall when I suspect it to sale at more than half the current price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Alexa is pretty much the same on both units. The big disappointments with the Spot are: 1) setup is not nearly as easy on the Spot as on the Show; 2) the Spot's screen is so dim, it is difficult to see in all but the darkest of spaces; and 3) the Spot looks up, which is great if you set it down low (like on the floor) but not so great if it is higher, such as on a counter or bookshelf.

Setting up the Echo Show was very easy. It already knew it was registered to me, and most of what I needed to do was either done on the touch screen, or on the app on my phone. Setting up the Spot should have been the same, but it wasn't. First, the Spot asks me to put in my amazon credentials -- on a tiny dark screen -- and then tells me that a user with my name is already associated with the spot. After some fumbling around (because it is hard to see) I somehow got back to a screen with my name and an invitation to continue. OK, dodged that problem. BUT, on the second Spot (I bought 3 of them) I had the same problem. At least forewarned, I typed in the info, got the message, and backed out to see my name and the Next button.

The screen is DIM, and I don't mean a little, it is dim. In a dark room, it is great, but otherwise, almost unusable except that it is voice controlled. If you don't really need a screen, get the Dot and save the money. There is no command to change the brightness, and no manual button.

update: did some more research. It isn't documented anywhere (no manual) and you can't just tell Alexa to brighten the screen, but there are screen controls. To access the controls, swipe down on the screen from the top. Jeez, Amazon, come on. Why hide that away and NOT let it be accessed by voice?

Here is an article that gives a lot of info on the settings: https://mashtips.com/customize-alexa-echo-spot/
It would have been nice if Alexa could have told me all this. :-( Any way, I am upgrading the rating to 3 stars.

Finally, the angle of view is looking up. Gets a good view of the ceiling, unless you put it down low. In my boy's room, I put it on the window sill, works great there, but in my room, on the night stand, mostly all I see is the ceiling. If you want to use the Spot to see what is going on in your house, you won't see as much as you'd like. Also, the spot is basically a sphere with two flat sides, so it won't mount on the wall either.

In general, the screen is not a great advantage, and the camera is less than useful because of the angle up orientation.

All in all, it is a nice idea, but I wish I hadn't bought 3. If you think you want it, just get one and try it out. Probably, an Echo Dot will work just as well.

One other item to discuss: all Alexa devices require a login. You can login with the same account on all of them, which solves some problems, but causes others. I have a wife and two kids. Alexa assumes everyone is me, because I logged in with my Amazon account on all the devices. So? It means the reminders are mine, the alarms are mine, the calendars are mine... all my stuff on every device.

Amazon, if you really want to make Alexa useful, you need to make Alexa family-aware. If my son updates the calendar on the Spot in his room, it should stay with him, and he doesn't need to know about my appointments. The Echo Show in the kitchen is a community device for the entire house, but the Spot or Dot on the nightstand should be much more personal, especially for alarms and calendars. And Drop In should work for all the devices, no matter who the device is personalized for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love Alexa. In fact, I have them all over my house, so no matter where you are, if you say ""Alexa"" you'll get an answer. Sometimes even typing the name will prompt a response. Okay, that last sentence isn't really true. I never thought much about getting the Spot, primarily because the screen seemed so small. But then I saw that my sister had one by her bed. She uses it primarily as a clock (it has about 1 million clock faces, and by 1 million I mean at least 50). For that reason alone it is nice to have. When I go to bed I ask her to set a music alarm and the next morning she wakes me up to whatever kind of music I want. You can even adjust it so the music starts quietly and gradually gets louder until you wake up. That's a great feature. As an added bonus, I have it scroll thru family pictures during the day, which is rather nice. Other than that, she does everything any other Alex device does. The sound is not great, but I have it hooked up to a stereo system so that is not an issue. I love this as a bedside device and highly recommend it.

I told my husband I got it for him and his gift to me was setting it up.  It was a bit beyond my pay grade in techie stuff.  But if you have a handy husband like mine or someone else in your family, you will soon be asking Alexa questions and tell her to turn your TV on.  It isn't easy, but worth the effort and fun. Even my husband had a bit of a trial but he prevailed and Alexa is up and running.  We have to refer to her as Alex when we are talking about programming Alexa to do something because she is right there listening to our every word and ready to respond at the mention of her name.  She is still not up and doing fully what she is capable of -- but we like her so well we want to get another Echo Spot for another room.  My one disappointment is the Echo  has to remain plugged in at all times and cannot be moved about without unplugging and plugging in to another room.

I got it mainly for the clocks. I use it mainly as an alarm clock along with my first generation echo which is right beside it. Both are next to my bed on a night stand. This product has 12 clocks 6 analog and 6 digital. It also lets you use your own pictures from your phone on the clocks. I like the analog ones best. Clocks keep great time and have a second hand that moves. There are a lot of alarms ot to choose from or you can tell Alexa to wake you up to music from amazon,your amazon music library,siriusxm,spotify,I heart radio,tune in etc. Note you need to have some of these like siriusxm and spotify already. When Alarm goes off you see good morning and the time,weather condition and temperature which I think is nice. Alarm last for 1hr but you can also snooze or dismiss it.

The Spot also does everything all the other Echo Speakers do with Alexa plus you can watch videos,see some video news from cnn and some other news outlets,see you're local weather and forcast,view amazon when you're shopping and watch shows from Amazon Video and not to mention all the skills that like ordering a pizza,movie times etc.

Update
I have the white echo spot and meant to write a review on it but the black is the same device with just a different color.

Update
Amazon added 5 new clocks. 4 Analog Clocks and 1 Digital. Hope we see even more. I love the tangerine. This update went unnoticed by most people but it happened. I'll post some pics. Note these colors look a lot better then they do from my camera phone.

Things I like
Being able to see your weather forcast and conditions especially the temperature and 7 day forcast.

Most videos are adjustable as to how it looks on the screen however music albums and art isn't.

The clocks

Music sounds much better and louder on the Spot then it does on the Dot.

Has an option to hook up an additional wired or blue tooth speaker.

Has nightmode so most of the clocks projects a pretty green glow at night. Some just have a dim background.

When an alarm is set you can see you have it set under the clock.

Things I don't like

Not enough analog clocks and the ones it comes with has only 2 colors and sometimes 1 eg the record theme clock has only one color version. Amazon says more clocks are coming in the future though thru updates. More colors are needed like red,blue,orange,green,purple and yellow. Also I've suggested a weather themed clock which shows your local temperature.

The Spot can't get Youtube but that can change if Amazon gets it back. The Show can no longer get Youtube either.

Music Album Covers are too big for the Spot. You don't seem to have an option to decrease the size so you can see more like you do with videos. Same with recipes. Album Art still looks ok though. For recipes you're better off using the Echo Show.

I recommend this device for you're bedroom night stand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_376?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=376&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One did not work because no matter what I did the alarm clock feature didn't work (the most important function). But after spending 30 minutes on the phone with a non-english speaking technical support and doing a factory reset(the reason for 4 stars and not 5) it works just fine. Alexa would repeat the alarm time back to me but not go off. When asking Alexa to show the alarms the screen would flicker then go back to the home screen. After the reset it works just fine. The only gripe I have is that the option for setting the repeat option for the alarms does not allow you to pick which days of the week you want it to repeat. I only need an alarm Monday through Thursday but you can't pick more than one individual day. It's either weekends, weekdays, or only mondays, only Tuesdays, etc.

Using the app on my phone allows me to ""drop in"" and see what the camera sees right on my phone. Very convenient way to communicate when away from home. The kids find it hilarious to video chat from room to room. When one of my kids is listening to music too loud I can asked Alexa to turn the volume down on that specific device or use the app to turn it down.

The sound quality is better than expected. Not tinny at all and has some bass to it. Comes with an equalizer option for those more advanced. Fills the room with loud music without distorting it at all.

Added plugs all over the house and it is an awesome experience walking in the house and asking Alexa to turn the lights on rather than trip over something or stub my toe on furniture in the dark trying to turn the lights on. You can even use the app to turn them on away from home.

The many skills that can be added is amazing. One of the best is having Alexa start my vehicles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I need to qualify that because maybe there are more possibilities if I was able to speak to Alexa in the morning.

So my review based on this scenario is: A lot of potential, but still not quite there.  I love the flexibility and the ability to micromanage alarms, but snoozing it is nearly impossible.  The reason for Snoozing an alarm is because you’re just not ready to get up. If I need to wake up just to get it to snooze, it pretty much defeats the purpose of snoozing.  Also, and maybe it’s because I haven’t google searched it yet, but I still haven’t been able to figure out how to make the display brighter.

Again, my review might be better if I was able to say “Alexa, snooze” instead of having to fumble for a “snooze” icon on poorly lit screen.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We also chose this device to use in conjunction with a nursery CloudCam. The only drawback to using as a nursery cam is the screen size. It can be challenging to see your young one in this screen. Also, you cannot zoom to specific areas as you can with the CloudCam app. There is a zoom function, but it only zooms to the center of the camera's vision.

If using only as an alarm clock or as a video communication tool, I would rate a full 5 stars. Since the CloudCam functionality is limited, I give this 4 stars.

Anyway I love I can just talk to it and not roll over and have to hit buttons to silence the alarm.  All in all it far exceeds my expectations, it is small and doesn’t take up a lot of room on my small nightstand.  I still have plenty room for my Kindle Oasis and pad now.  It’s also really cute, we bought skins to help protect it and brighten it up..I opted for hot pink, Hubby got a pretty blue...We have the original and updated Alexa and a few dots as well as the tap and this blows them al, away. Now I’m not picky about my sic sound, but I am happy with the way the music sounds and the only change I wish for..are new names...we are running out of device names...it would be nice to name it myself or with all the ones we have maybe a few new selections of names..Tha is Amazon we are both very happy!😀","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The first Amazon device I am returning.","January 12, 2018","I really wanted to like it, but it just fails as an alarm clock.  The first Amazon device I am returning.

I wanted an echo in my bedroom, so I figured I would kill two birds with one stone.  Get rid of my alarm clock and replace it with the Spot.  In theory this should have worked.  Here is why it fails as an alarm clock.

1) You cannot manage the alarms from the touch screen, except to dismiss them.  If it's 11:30 at night and you want to set the alarm, you have to talk to it.  My wife didn't appreciate this.  I don't understand why I cant tap the screen and turn the alarm on.
2) The alexa app lets you set the recurring alarm M-F.  The problem is most of the time I dismiss the alarm from the Spot it will cancel the entire week.  I cant just dismiss the Monday for example.
3) Worst of all, the alarm did not work the last three mornings.  This is unacceptable.  I have a $30 alarm that never failed to wake me up.  I would go to bed and the alarm would show on the display.  I woke up at 5am and the alarm was not shown.  So i told Alexa to set the alarm (again my wife did not appreciate this).  Alexa said it was already set.  Of course, it did not wake me up and I had to hustle so i wasn't late for work.

I find this unacceptable.  These are really very basic functions.  You can even initiate the alarm from the app.  You have fist tell the Spot to set an alarm then you can go the app and set it to recur, change the tones, etc..  It is just really a disjointed experience.

If you don't care about the alarm then this is a really nice device.  Screen is clear and build quality is great.  Sounds much better than the dot.  I just can't play Russian roulette with alarm hoping it will wake me up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_279?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=279&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(I couldn't resist)","April 19, 2018","Just about anything I could write about the spot would sound like marketing literature.  We purchased two Spots and a Show (and a dot and two of the original Echo towers) -- clearly, we're believers.  The Show is in our kitchen and we have it flanked by two (for stereo) Oontz Ultra speakers -- and we liked it so much we went ahead and got the Spots one for an upstairs bedroom and one for the downstairs master bedroom. We also linked the master bedroom spot with a Sony Bluetooth speaker (one of the XB models with ""extra bass"") in order to use Alexa's sleep sounds capabilities while keeping the ""clock"" face closer to the bed.

The video is good to very good Spot to Spot and Spot to Show, etc.

If you were (or are) an iPhone fan, you may recall the choice you could have either a 6 or a 6-plus etc. Believe it or not, I think there could be a market for a Spot-Plus.  There is nothing wrong with the ""original"" spot -- the screen is 2.5"" however.  Perhaps a 3.5"" or even 4"" screen could find consumers willing to part with another $20 or $30 for a screen (the Spot hardware itself) that would allow placement a bit further away than your bedside table.  A Show, if you asked me, would be too big for this purpose, but perhaps a Spot-Plus especially if you want the thing to be both an ""intercom"" (with video) and a full-featured Smart-Clock.

 Even if Amazon never comes out with such an in-between device, the Spot is a winner!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Luckily I haven't had any emergencies but I'm still glad he purchased it for me because the Echo Spot comes in handy!  I've used it to add things to my grocery list, check the weather and news, and set timers and alarms.

I have a picture of my boys as my background which I also love and since it's black it blends in nicely on my end table.

But I would say that it is a bit pricey at $130 for a glorified clock.

Setup was easy. Just logged into my wifi, and off and running. I made some simple adjustments on the screen with a few swipes, and some that needed to be done from the Alexa App. All set.

It has several clock faces that are art or digital face. You can even use your own photos, too (I chose our Pit, Nutmeg). You can make video calls to anyone with a Spot, or the pricier Show, or even to an Alexa app on their phones, if enabled. The video call was clear and voice was amazingly perfect.

Music sounded as expected--some bass, but the overall sound was pleasantly surprising for such a small device. It sounded louder than its little sibling, the Dot, and that's a feather in Amazon's hat.  Amazon issued an update a week ago so now there's an equalizer setting for bass, mid, and highs. It does help some. If you have a good Bluetooth speaker, or one that uses 3.5mm cable to connect, I suggest you do so if you plan on entertaining.

I like the  little guy. As far as YouTube videos are concerned, though, don't hold your breath.  There probably won't be a meeting of the minds, as Amazon and Google won't make nice with one another.  Shame.

Those who cook can use the gadget for seeing recipes. You can watch short news clips, or other boring crap--and that's that, save for Amazon Videos. So if you plan on looking into purchasing the Echo Show, with its much larger screen and fantastic sound, think wisely before plunking down over $230.  Is it really worth that much to be able to watch movies from Amazon's video service?  If you positively must have the Show, purchase a refurbished one, and save up to $60.00--why pay more? It would worth it IF YouTube were a part of the Show. Sadly, it's a no-Show for now and evermore.

IF you're entrenched in the Amazon-centric world of online buying, watching movies with your Amazon membership on a tiny 2.5"" screen doesn't seem a likely thing that will catch on. Really. How long can one watch full-length movies on a screen the size of a baseball?  At least with the Echo Show there's more real estate: seven inches of low-resolution. Hell, your tablet is probably bigger than that with a higher pixel density!

If you have a hankering for a small video-call gadget that also plays music, news briefs, weather, even videos, then I say go for it.  But see if you can get a better price by looking for a refurbished unit.  You may find one for less that $90.00 if you try.

If you already have an Echo or Dot, you're not missing much except for the screen, and having a screen on a device this small does nothing to really enhance the experience your larger screen phone can provide.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use them in garage, kitchen, bedrooms, etc.  They are great for music management (I use Sonos), and controlling my various lights (Hue) and locks (Schlage).  I will say I'm on the fence with the Spot.

My biggest beef is Amazon's comfort to advertising on it's products.  After paying $125 for a product, I don't expect to have multiple click throughs to turn down products of Amazon's.  Call it a pet-peeve, but I feel it's stepping over the line.  Different if they were giving these away.  To top it off, the decline is preset as 'no thank you'.  I personally would be more apt to click a button called 'NO and stop advertising on my device'.

The device is somewhat an expensive bedside clock as it's too small to really be of great data value.  The weather and such can be displayed, but I haven't come across a really solid reason to pay this much more over one the simply speaks the weather.  It does add some value in 'seeing' things like your 'alarm clock' set time verses just listening to it.  This gives a sense that it heard exactly what I told it.  Still playing and looking for a solid win on this one as it's not far off from equally effective as a Dot.

Hope this helps others understand what they are getting into.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_338?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=338&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If your debating between echo models I believe this is the one to go with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_208?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=208&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen display is amazing and the speaker quality is exceptional! Perfect for dance sessions!
I really love: the lyrics that you can see when listening to music, how you can read her responses as well as hear them, see the time/temp, see random news stories flash through the screen all day, and how you can watch your prime videos on the spot!!

I really like it!","January 3, 2018","Pre-ordered in case I needed an extra Christmas gift.  I have echo's new and old all over the house including an echo show.  Didn't end up needing it as a gift and fully intended on returning it.  I figured it's small, sound wouldn't be great, and doubted the usefulness of such a tiny screen. And as others have mentioned you could get a show for not much more dough.  But it kept staring at me so I decided to open it and check it out.  So here's the thing...it's flipping adorable!  And it's perfect for what it's designed for.  Perfect for the bedroom and a perfect alarm clock. Realized the speaker is adequate for the bedroom (I had to actually think about how very little I listen to music there).  I also realized all I use my bedroom echo for is alarms, weather, and some smart home stuff. Sounds better than the dot obviously, but no bass due to its size so no where near as good as a regular echo.  Nice touch to add audio out via cable and Bluetooth in case I ever need it.  Also it's really nice to see my calendar reminders, the weather, and see my Amazon cameras. So yeah, the lil guy really won me over within 15 minutes.  Reminds me of the little chumby I had years ago! Some random things I saw in other reviews that weren't right btw... Yes you can turn off the tips, yes you can connect speakers, phones and headphones via Bluetooth, yes you can disable the camera (or tape over it if you're really paranoid), yes it gets really dim at night if you want it to.  Also I know some reviewers complained about them (were almost offended by them), but I really like the tips!  Even though I turned them off on the spot, I use them all the time on my echo show.  I am an expert user but the ""try"" this tips can be fun and informative.  Alexa does ALOT so it's nice to learn a couple new things or even be reminded here and there. The only knock is the price. But like I said, spend a little time with it and you are like fine!...I really like you!  I'll keep you, even though you're a little too expensive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not sure if you can control your thermostat and security systems with the Dot, but obviously the Dot does not have the small monitor to view live coverage of what your security system can see.

I love it!","July 2, 2018","I read a lot of reviews and saw a lot of YouTube videos before I bought this. I already have a house full of Echo products, a second gen. Echo, two Echo Dots, and two Sonos One Alexa enabled speakers. So I thought, why do I need another one?

My main intention with purchasing this was to replace the Echo Dot in my bedroom. I have it connected to a Bose Wave Radio that I've had for years which greatly improves the sound, but it's very boring looking. I wanted something more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Well, this Echo Spot does just that! This thing is beautiful and so cute. The addition of the LCD color screen makes all the difference and I love the ball shape, definitely give it character. The ability to change and customize all the clock faces is really fun. The interaction of the display when you play music (sometimes with lyrics), video news, weather displays, etc., makes it worth the price in my opinion.

The sound from the little speaker is still pretty sub par, but definitely better than the Echo Dot. I would strongly suggest connecting it to a Bluetooth speaker if you're going to be playing any music on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Don't get me wrong! This is accurate advertisement and everything you read is absolutely true.

I am surprised by the sound quality produced by the Echo Dot 3rd generation. I guess I expect more out of Echo Spot especially it's 3 times the price of an Echo dot.
Yes I get it, Echo dot does not have screen or these wonderful display. however Comparatively speaking of all Alexa Family Echo Spot speakers are disappointing :( (I own echo plus, echo dot and 2 echo spots, I got them all during Black Friday)

I say just spend a little more money and get the Echo Show.
I will be returning my 2 Echo Spots (one is unopened ) and use that money to get either echo plus/show or dot.

It works great!  I only have a couple of complaints:

1. The interface makes it a bit difficult to set alarms.  It can be done, but not as easily as others (I'd previously used a Sonos One speaker).  With the Spot, I need to create five separate alarms since I have a different wake-up time one day per week.  Alexa defaults to either a single day every week or ""weekdays"" and ""weekends.""  It is also more complicated than it should be to wake-up to music (ie., a TuneIn radio station) instead of using a stock alarm sound.

2. The speaker is worse than the original Echo Dot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_69?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=69&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unlike the Echo Show, which takes up more room but still disappoints with the sound, the Spot has a footprint similar to that of the Dot, and provides a screen that is large enough to display the time and other information.

The touchscreen is responsive; interacting with it takes little effort. The brightness responds to changes in lighting conditions, so you don't have this bright glowing thing in the darkness of the night.

The Spot sound better than the Dot, and could pass as an alarm clock speaker.

What seems to be missing in the settings, however, is the ability to pair the Spot with a bluetooth speaker. This is how we use most of the Dots in our home, and that is how I would like to be able to use the Spot. I am sure this is an oversight in the settings, and should get resolved soon.

I do think that the price point needs to be lower. The Spot is $50 more than the Echo that sounds better, and only $20 less than the Show that has a larger (albeit uselessly larger) screen. I think the right price point for the Spot is $100 or $110.

So far, I'm happy, and hopeful that the bluetooth settings will appear soon on alexa.amazon.com.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_486?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=486&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very happy with it. Not only can I go to sleep now listening to my music, I now have a great bedside clock again, which beats using my phone. And it has decent alarm which actually wakes me up on time.
I have also used it for listening to my Audible Audiobooks and newsflashs briefings.
I understand it can be used for videos. But that really does not interest me, so I haven't tried it, nor the video calling feature, since I do not have any family or friends that currently own an Echo device.

I was hoping to buy this, and have it display the temperature at all times, but the best it can do is stay on the home clock, or rotate between screens. You cannot remove the, ""try things,"" feature at all. So Alexa will always recommend you try asking things like, ""how the spell, 'rhythm,'"" because I guess Alexa assumes the American education system failed me like everyone else. Needless to say, out of the box, it was very frustrating trying to troubleshoot this to do the most simple things.

It feels very well made.  However, I find it only a slight improvement over an Echo Dot due to limitations and odd behavior.  For example, one minor odd behavior is the one shown in the picture.  If you ask Alexa to turn up the volume, the device pauses the video and overlays the screen with some controls that don’t even include volume control. Why? I don’t know anyone who wants to watch TV that way. Oh well...

Pros:

* Good looking hardware
* It’s a good alarm clock.
* Includes the same function as an Echo Dot

Cons:

* You cannot play the same videos you can play in the Prime Video app or through a Firestick. For example, no Netflix.
* No YouTube.
* The Spot’s display does not integrate as a target/action in IFTTT or Stringify*
* The Spot doesn’t pick up voice as well as a Dot**
* Alexa is much louder than video.
* You cannot schedule the display to be turned off automatically at night.
* You cannot change the font, font size, and font color for time (especially noticeable when you a photo backdrop)
* It has an LCD display instead of OLED
* It insists on pausing video to turn up volume.
* Annoying default rotation for things to try.

Footnotes:

* It’s true that neither Alexa nor any Echo integrates as an IFTTT or Stringify target (just a trigger), but the situation is more noticeable with a Spot for all the simple things you cannot do with its screen. For example, update the clock’s background image automatically from a variety of sources.

** The Spot has 4 microphones, the Dot 7 (according to specs). This was very noticeable when I was sitting in bed, the Spot was next to me on a nightstand and the Dot would reply from across the room. I had to move the Dot so that Spot could reply","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_356?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=356&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Then there's the sound quality.  You really CAN use it as a speaker and be quite satisfied with the quality of music.  I also like using Echo Spot with my Arlo cameras to see who's at the front door or getting my Flash Briefing with accompanying video.

Camera can be disabled.","December 26, 2017","I absolutely love this thing. I had an Echo Show in my bedroom but it took up a lot of space on my nightstand. It is now in the kitchen and this replaced it perfectly. This looks like a modern alarm clock that will blend in seamlessly with your bedroom decor. This is the perfect compromise of size and function.

The Camera
Personally, I say so what. Many people are worried about privacy concerns. If you have a cell phone, it most likely has a camera and a microphone that can record too. Just like a cell phone, you can disable the camera in settings and also mute the mics. If you absolutely do not trust it, you can put electric tape over the camera like many do to a laptop. Not a big deal for me. The features and capabilities GREATLY outweigh this perceived ""negative"".

The Screen
This is the best alarm clock on the market hands down. If you own an Echo Show, then you know how nice it is to have a screen to go with Alexa. You can customize the clock face on your alarm clock however you like. You can see your calendar and upcoming appointments. You can watch movies from Prime video. You can watch the news video broadcast in the mornings with your flash briefing. There are so many things you can do with this. I use it to check cameras in my house to look after my sleeping baby and to see who is at the front door or in the backyard. Tons of promise here.

The Sound
Simply put, this is just okay sound. It sounds better than the Echo Dot, but not as good as the Echo Show. You can plug in a set of speakers using the auxiliary port or you can go Bluetooth. As we all know, the Echo product line does not compare to Sonos or Bose. They won't be bringing any awards home for sound of the year. If you are an audiophile you probably will not be using this for playing music in your bedroom anyway.

Alexa
If you are looking at the echo product line you probably already know what you can do with Alexa. What I'll do is basically share how I use it. I have put in smart plugs and switches so I can turn on and off lights without getting out of bed. I use it to turn on and off ceiling fans and to view my Arlo cameras and Ring doorbell. I can ask Kevo if the front door is locked and not have to go downstairs to find out. Alexa is a growing ecosystem and is compatible with the most smart devices of AI available.

The Verdict
Must buy! If you are looking at this, you should get this. Something about it caught your eye which means you are interested in a smart alarm clock. I tried hard to find something wrong with this device. The only thing I could wish was better is the sound quality. This is a must buy for all bedrooms!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_110?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=110&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I never trusted my phone 100% and always preferred an alarm clock.  The best part about this is not having to navigate for any buttons, it just does exactly what I tell her to do.  It picks up on my voice super easily.  I enjoy the snooze a bit too much, and it's really convenient when I can just say ""Alexa, snooze"" and it gives me 10 more minutes.  To stop the alarm, I just say "" Alexa, stop"".  It's also a great deal to get the amazon music for about $5 a month, which allows you to play any song at any time.  I love to set reminders about things I need to take to work that day, or ask about the weather as I'm picking out an outfit.  I don't use the call feature or many of the other features, but what I do use it for, is worth it to me.  I'm getting my daughter one for Christmas this year and we are getting one for the living room.  I thought it would be nice to the have the music feature in other rooms, plus contact each other through Alexa.

I have no issues. All Echo devices I unplug and plug back in every once in a while to reboot, I have done a reboot with the Echo Spot once in the month I have owned. Yes, this has a camera and small speaker, which features I use a lot. I am not worried about privacy since I have webcams, tablets, cell phones, and TVs with microphones and cameras laying around the house already.
  The hardware is everything I wanted after owning the Echo Show. Echo Show is just too big for a desk, better on the counter or a bigger piece of furniture like a secretary. Same screen, just smaller and round. Nicer sound than an Echo Dot. Great display. This fits nice on a desk or nightstand. I tried on the nightstand one night, it was neat watching the news and a quiet movie to fall asleep to. In the end, it sits on the desk. Because there are so many useful features, I chose to stare at it all day usually tuning into different exterior/interior cameras to check out what the family is doing while I am working.

Things I like:
1. I have the Spot sitting on my home office desk. I also have an  Echo Show in the Living Room by the front door. I like that I can ""drop in"" on any Echo for voice intercom, and ""Drop in"" on the Living Room for video intercom via Echo Show.
2. I like that cheap cameras like the EZVIZ series connect really well to the Spot. I don't need to spend major money on higher end Arlos, etc.
3. I like the screen a lot. I like the scrolling information, especially the extra Alexa tips. It makes me use Alexa more in general and helps me grow my ""alexa capabilities"".
  3.1 - I like the touch screen. Scrolling through lists, pausing music, etc. is SOMETIMES easier vs. talking to Alexa.

Favorite Alexa commands on this device:
""Alexa show me the patio camera"".
""Alexa show me my lists""
""Alexa play Joe Rogan podcast on Sonos""

TLDR:
Would highly recommend this device to anyone, especially those new to the world of Alexa. Full featured and more versatile than Echo Show, this rounds out Amazons Echo offerings very well. Obviously Amazon is listening to customers and getting some great hardware out the door. I am trying to think of a negative with this device but strangely cannot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_60?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=60&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We use it mostly as clock, alarms, weather and news. Let me tell you a couple of things that many people ask and nobody gives a straight answer:
* How to setup it: From the device itself, but it's easier from the cellphone Alexa app (you add the ""Alexa"" devices to your account and can manage them from there).
* Alarm clock: Yes, you can use it as alarm clock. You can setup alarm for the entire week, weekdays, weekend, etc. You can setup multiple alarms with multiple tones (including the classic alarm). To snooze it you touch the screen, to stop it you have to say ""Alex stop"".
* It has a nice feature where you can setup certain actions at certain time, i.e.: you can tell the device to tell you the temperature and forecast every day at 7am.

Speaker is not the best as you would suspect but I already had a nice Bose bluetooth speaker in that room and it connects with it easily and it gives me access to my prime music account so I am all set with music when I need it. But you can also ask Alexa for help on allot of things while you are working, like weather, the date, stock market updates, spelling of a word, and tons of other things. You can also access your audio books or podcast. Its great at placing calls if you enable it to do so. Works really well and looks great. Highly recommend adding this to your home.

CONS:
The Quality of the camera on the spot is horrible in Low light(lamp on) it is unusable.
it's tiny.
theres a half inch frame around the display that is black so the entire surface is NOT screen.
the display colors of the camera are off badly, very blue tinted, and it's very grainy.
For the price point you can buy a second hand device of another brand that has a 7 inch screen and is crystal clear.
can't turn off the ""ask Alexa...."" function.
can't turn off the  'news highlights""
you have to repeatedly issue commands because she cant ""hear"" you
music is kinda muffled. possibly due to the size.

Pros
when you ask for your daily review it is presented well.
videos played are decent resolution
you have the ability to tweak the equalizer for music, that's helpful
The clock is fun, but as a feature it doesn't warrant the price you pay for it

overall i'm glad i got mine at a discounted price, i paid full price for his, but they have both been returned and i'm buying a different device that allows me to actually SEE him...

meh...don't recommend

****UPDATE****
Amazon Consumer Services called me the day after leaving this negative review to discuss my opinions and ask for suggestions on how to improve the product. The conversation was pleasant, and not intrusive. Although it did shock me they called.

It was nice to know they actually monitor these reviews, and want to improve their products. Unlike some other reviewers angry with the calls, I was pleased with the personal service. Knowing we are going to be treated as human consumers, and not just a statistic, is a positive move for a conglomerate of this size and stature.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It took less than 20 minutes to set up all my alarms and preferences - and 10 minutes of that was waiting for the firmware update to install!
Since we already own an Echo (1st gen), I found the set up process to be very easy and intuitive, even if It had to be deregistered first (my Wife forgot to ✔ that little box). The sound is quite impressive for its size, as is the screen clarity, even though some reviewers have complained about this; and yes, I took the time to read all the reviews and answered questions before setting it up - the other reviewers tips saved me a lot of angst.
Some complained that the camera couldn't be shut off, but there was a simple button in the Settings Menu to do just that; since this will be on my nightstand, we didn't want to accidentally ""flash"" the Internet! Additionally,  I had no complaints about the selection of clock faces, and I'm sure more choices will be added in the future- after all, the Spot is only 6 days old... Give it some time, people!

It sits on my bedroom nightstand and gets used every day:

- as alarm (can be configured to your favorite music or your radio station via TuneIn)
- listening to my audible book before I fall asleep
- listening to music while taking a bath
- adding things to my shopping list while I am getting ready in the mornings
- taking photos of my kids
- future use: video calls with my mom

I really like the touch screen and also the buttons, so I can easily change the volume without actually having to stop the narrator.

I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars, though, because

- No youtube support (come on, Amazon and Google, get your act together!)
- I find it too easy to cancel/dismiss an alarm. A single tap on the screen is snooze, but multiple times now the device confused snooze with cancel and let me without alarm. So now I am still using my cellphone alarm as backup
- I can't figure out how to link my Alexa alarm to ""Routines"". I have a good morning routine that switches on my lamp and tells me the weather etc, would be great if that could be triggered by an alarm.

I've now ordered a smart bulb for my nightstand lamp, I wonder if I can link this to my alarm, so the light comes on when the alarm goes off...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_230?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=230&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Lastly and it is just annoying for me - when I say Alexa snooze she says “ok snoozy” not sure why snoozy bothers me but just an okay would be sufficient","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_28?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=28&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The Amazon Echo really is voice activating the home.

So why do I especially like the Echo Spot?  I think the clock face is awesome and it now has a place next to the bed replacing the clock radio alarm which has a world of information including weather and streaming internet and 11 minutes more of snooze time, just for the asking.

Logic would dictate you would at least get a warning that the routine can’t run at that time. I use routines as an alarm and I learned about this limitation the hard way. I also have an amazon basics Bluetooth speaker and the echo devices randomly stop being able to connect to it. At first I thought I did something wrong with my other Echo device so I paired it to the Spot and the same thing happened, it just stopped pairing and keeps telling me the speaker is not in pair mode.

Scott","Great alarm clock, not so good speaker","April 1, 2018","I love my Echo Spot. I used it to replace a sound machine and add an alarm clock back to my nightstand. I will admit the screen quality. It’s sharp but to be honest it’s not entirely user friendly figuring out how to use it. There are not enough clock faces either. I’d also prefer the speaker be louder than it is. Most of these are minor issues that can be addressed with a software update. The speaker maybe not so much.

I'm going to address the huge glaring issue I had though first.

I set my Echo Spot up and it was ready to go like past Amazon devices.  Great!  Wifi set up without issue, I saw it in the Alexa app and it even had the ability to set up the multi room uses/music listening.  All things were great!  I then asked it to turn off a group of my Hue lights.  Alexa said she didn't see them.  I thought maybe because I'd recently updated my Hue lights software, that was an issue.  Hue was finicky in the past, but not anymore so I was curious.  I asked Alexa about news, she got that.  Showed me a CNN video brief too, that was great.  I then wanted to test the music sound as it's supposed to be better than my Echo Dot - Alexa couldn't find the artist I asked.  Hmmm, ok let's just do a genre.  Alexa couldn't find any Pop music.  She didn't find any jazz or any classical.

At this point it couldn't do much of anything but time, weather, and news.  Which is most of what Alexa could do on day one, but it's grown since then and I expect the best from it.  I let it sit a couple days thinking all the updates had to happen.  I even reset it after trying to get it to play music or see lights in the home or the thermostat.  Since this had a screen, I asked it to play one of the shows my son watches KNOWING it's a Prime Exclusive show made by Amazon.  This is when Alexa finally told me I had to switch to the primary user to do that.  I asked it to switch to my name and BOOM, Alexa was happy.

I have no earthly idea if it was set up without the account or I was a 'guest'.  I bought this on my account which pays for Prime and is the main account.  I manually logged into my account after the reset which again is the account Prime is tied to.  It works great now.

I love how it sounds better - huge improvement over the Dot.  I know the Dot isn't big and physics limits the speaker, but come on.  Put a decent one in to power Alexa's voice if anything.  The Spot has a passable speaker.  Sounds very nice and fills my office - granted it's the smallest room in the home but eh.  Voices, as I mentioned a second ago, also sound way better.  Alexa's voice, the CNN lady on the news brief, etc.

The screen is great too.  I didn't buy this as an alarm clock replacement, I wanted the camera (I'll address soon) and other video/display options this enables.  I like seeing a quick picture to go with the news.  It's much better to chat with my son when he's home and I'm at work - plus it bugs my wife when I do it.  Recipes have pictures too.  Lastly, seeing the item I'm ordering is good - sometimes the deals through Alexa aren't clear and I don't want to buy the 50 razor pack because of poor labeling by a seller.

Alexa and her skills are great.  Now that I'm on my actual account, Hue lights come on and off.  The Nest Thermostat works flawlessly.  I look forward to the new skills coming with Echos that have screens now.

I'll end with the camera.  It works fine, like most front facing cameras on cell phones these days.  The test calls so far haven't had issue.  I don't get or like the incredibly long 'soft fade' in type thing on the calls.  My connections were strong, so video should have been clear.  My other thing about the camera - obviously it has one.  Why are there reviews going on about it?  Simply don't purchase an always connected camera if you are worried - end of story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I normally don't keep my cell phone in the bedroom at night, but if I don't I won't hear any alerts if someone is lurking around my front yard.  The Echo Spot seemed like a great solution to this, and it could replace my alarm clock.

The actual hardware is better than I expected.  I expected some lightweight plastic device with a screen and speaker, but it's fairly heavy and seems like a well built device.  The screen is very nice and crisp and the audio is much better than I expected for a device this size.  It supports Bluetooth but inexplicably, it can't connect to my phone to answer calls, only as a speaker.  I don't really care much about that, but it's a strange limitation nonetheless.

It does a pretty good job as an alarm clock replacement, and it's convenient to ask questions about the weather, traffic or whatnot while I'm getting dressed. However, it is a near total FAIL when it comes to the reason I purchased it, which is for it's integration with my Ring doorbell.  All it can do is view the doorbell camera.  It does NOT notify me when the motion detection goes off, or if someone pushes the doorbell.  How stupid is that?  So I still have to keep my cell phone in the bedroom at night to receive any notifications from Ring.

I don't know if this is Amazon's fault or Ring's fault, but since Ring is now owned by Amazon it doesn't matter.  Ring is part of the Amazon family and the Alexa Ring ""skill"" should be a shining example of what you can do with the Echo devices.  Instead, it's an example of a nearly useless skill, and should be an embarrassment to everyone involved with Ring/Alexa development.  Something is very wrong when a skill for an Amazon-owned product gets almost 1-star reviews from everyone.

I'll probably keep the Spot as it makes for a cool alarm clock, although I no longer actually need to get out of bed to hit the snooze button, which could be a problem.  Hopefully the brain-dead Ring integration will be fixed sooner or later.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

What I don’t like is that you can only set the screen to either be on or off all the time, there is no smart sleep mode on the screen or something like that.

No more static radio in the AM.  It'll find almost any radio station on either TuneIn or iHeart, so it won't skip a beat.  You can obviously also use Spotify or any other music streaming too, but if you're setting the bar low, as I am, it overachieves.  It's also nice to be able to ask it for time and weather, without opening your eyes. You need to use the slow Alexa app to set things like graduated alarm, so it doesn't come on blaring, but as soon you figure that out, you're good.  I guess you could do all these things, with any of the other Alexa devices, but if you're like me, and still like the concept of an alarm clock on the night stand you can look at.  In that case, this is a major upgrade!

Taking a star off for design shortcoming.  They could have put a small battery in the thing, in case you use power.  I'm also reading that, without internet, it's basically a paperweight, so not sure it'll wake you up if that happens either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_76?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=76&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had already, earlier in the year, gifted one to her younger sister, who does not have a phone (smart parents!) so we can drop in her, let her listen to her music, etc. I too have an Echo Spot also so adding another device sounded like a nice idea.

Well, it was not:
To begin with it activated itself in the middle of the night asking to be ""set up"". Talk about a spooky experience for a 12 year old.
I have connected my calendar for reminders and both granddaughters are being alerted to my next dentist appointment on Wed at 11am.
I could not drop in on her as Alexa insisted her device was not allowing that, even though it knew about her echo spot and was set up for drop ins.
When she said ""call mom"" (phone connection) her sister's and my echo spots both rang. Whoever answered first was connected.

And the list goes on and on and on.

My son spent 3 hrs with various technical customer support personnel to no avail. We are all very frustrated by the experience, including my disappointed granddaughter, whose Christmas present is being returned.

Amazon needs to work on the set up program specifically in a family account environment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Both snooze and disable should both not be a swipe  Too often we turn off our alarms and we meant to snooze.

There are mornings where my alarm goes off, and while I can usually just say...""Alexa, stop"" or ""Alexa, off"", I will get a response that she ""isn't connected to the internet"" and the alarm keeps going.

Display is ok for a bed side clock, but don't expect to use this to watch Prime movies - Its just too small and dull to use as for video.

Volume control is quirky... At volume level 1 there is absolutely no audio produced by the unit (same as mute), at volume level 2 the noise is hardly perceivable.  Volume level 3 is quite a jump up and is a bit too loud for bed side use. Volume 4 and up then step up in an expected linear fashion.

Alexa tech still has a long way to go to properly deal with human instructions.  If you tell the unit what to do precisely following the commands in the examples provided, it works like a charm.  However, remembering the proper construct of commands is a pain in the ... especially for 'learn' technologies.
EG:  ""Alexa, tell ASUS to turn on the guest wifi for 30 minutes"" works, but ""Alexa, turn on the guest internet for 30 minutes"" does not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It’s a very nice device, but since I also just installed my Echo Connect to my home VOIP phone system, I’ve found a shortcoming that should be able to be remedied by a software update: Making phone calls is very simple, however, many calls to businesses require a key entry (e.g., “Press 2 to connect to a technician.”) and that would be simple if the Echo Spot had the ability to display a phone keypad during a call. That feature is very similar to how the in-call screen works on an iPhone. The Echo Spot would find even more applications in my home, if I could use it in lieu of most of my cordless phone VOIP handsets. When I’m at home, even though I can place a call on any of my iOS devices, they still aren’t necessarily convenient and I like having voice capable fixed-location devices. With the number of Echo devices I have deployed, I can make typical calls from anywhere in the house, without having a device in hand. The Echo Spot is the only one (other than the Show, which is too bulky to be as many locations) that has the potential for ‘button presses’, unless there is an Alexa skill for inputting touch tones during a call.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_46?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=46&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's a blessing to know the time listed is accurate (it pings the wi-fi connection) and I don't have to do anything.  It goes into a dim mode at night so it saves on the battery and screen.  The alarm is loud, so waking up is not an issue.  But even better, instead of having to physically move to hit a snooze button, all I do is yell ""Alexa, snooze for 10 minutes"".  Boom, done.  Those 10 miinutes are blissfull since I never had to move.
I've also used it to send me reminders to my phone, play games with the kids, tell me the weather/news and even to find my cell phone in the house.  Yes, it's extremely expensive, but it's a keeper.
What I hate is the fact that for its price, the stand was an extra expense.

Some shortfalls as a clock and Privacy issues...","June 25, 2018","This is a nice addition to the old alarm clock.  I'm not a big Alexa fan, I just don't find that handy, but I do think this is a cool gadget clock.  Some shortfalls is there is not many ""skills"" other than weather and time, but does work nicely to have a weekday alarm only to Prim Music of your choice.  Another shortfall is the camera in the bedroom.  The software on the clock says that the camera is off, but is it really?  It's also always listening to your conversations.  Waiting for wake word Alexa.  So, not sure I like that either.  If you hit the mute all button, then the clock turns obnoxious Red color, so you really want to turn the listening back on to get rid of that.  Another thing is that you can't turn off the alarm early on the clock's touch screen.  Maybe I don't want to wake the wife, but I would have to say, ""Alexa, turn off alarm"".  That wakes people up!  My Bose alarm clock I can push a button on the remote to turn off before alarm time.  There are other little things like this that come up.  Would like more functionality on the LCD settings so you are not forced to speak to the device.  It also shows current temp.  Not that handy in 6AM.  I want to know what the high for the day will be, and I don't want to ask it (again to be quiet with still sleeping spouse).  I just want to see it on the rotating screens.  So, let's hope that this improves over time with software upgrades.  So, the last work is that it's a mixed bag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_229?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=229&reviewerType=all_reviews"

She is enjoying the Echo Spot since it is small and also functions as a clock on her nightstand besides having the very powerful capability of an Amazon Echo. She enjoys the Flash Briefing each day.

We were early adopters of the first (tall) Echo, and we since purchased the Echo Dot as well. The Echo Spot is the perfect blend of the two. Its small size makes it easy to find a spot in nearly any room in the house. Currently we have ours in the kitchen so we can add items to the shopping list, and discover the weather before heading out the door in the morning. The speakers in the Spot are clear, with nice sound that resonates throughout the large room. (I had complaints about the poor quality of music with the Dot, but not here). We purchased this model for the video chat feature, as we have family out of town. We purchased them a Spot, too, and now we're all able to chat Spot-to-Spot, but also Spot-to-Mobile, which is convenient.

However, controlling smart devices leaves a lot to be desired and no real way of getting help.  I have a smart plug called “my lights”.  When I tell Alexa to turn off/on “my lights”, I get the response that “a lot of items share that name, which one do you want”.  Saying it again gets me nowhere.  I only have one smart plug.  Turns out my iPhone will also control smart fixtures, without an issue.  I walked into the room and said Alexa, turn on my lights by mistake to My iPhone and the lights immediately turned on...... as Alexa was saying “l’m sorry, a lot of items share that name, which one do you want”.

Long story… for as long as I can remember I would set my previous radio alarm clock to 1010 WINS to wake me in the morning.  The echo spot seemed like a great replacement… smaller footprint… many more features than a simple alarm clock so I purchased it.  Everything was fine until last week when the Alexa voice informed me that 1010 WINS was moving from TuneIn to Radio.com.  That’s fine.  I thought I would be able to just reset the echo spot to use Radio.com.  No can do.  After August 1st the echo spot just beeps when the alarm goes off (annoying).  TuneIn doesn’t have my alternate station either.  So I am rating echo spot 1 star because the radio alarm function is now broken and I’m looking for a new clock radio.  it appears Amazon doesn’t realize that when you make a software product change you should probably test it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You would not expect this HUGE sound and clear sound quality from this handlheld adorable device. My favorite feature is the screen is always changing showing suggested videos recipes, ideas, things to try like skills or movie trailers. It keeps you in the KNOW. You can personalize the home screen/screensaver with your own photo etc. It is super intelligent - if it can not find what you ask it will give you suggestions. You can be vague like Alexa play a comedy from Amazon Prime video or more specific like Alexa play Dates from Hell Season 1 Episode 6. You can set your alarm to a song not a sound so you can wake up to your favorite song! I would need a clone to have enough time to explore all the wonderful functions, features, skills. She is such a great companion.  You can say show me your deals and you can shop, make lists, even make cat sounds - which my cat is a fan of. My cat was injured this weekend - we asked Alexa how do you care for a wounded cat. She gave me so many steps - better than a nursing assistant. You can video chat and the picture, call and sound quality are PERFECT!!!!!! There is nothing Alexa can not do. I have several dots - now the kids use them. You can enable music everywhere so I can play music on all Alexa devices throughout the house. It is perfectly compatible and super easy to set up with my smart home devices like EZ Viz cameras. I say Alexa show me Mom's room or the living room! Perfect for teens and a mom who is always working. It is not heavy and portable but is sturdy stable an robust. The length of the cord is helpful. I can not say enough about this purchase. I used the installment payments offered by Amazon so the spot shipped for $35! I mean you can NOT beat that! I am an advocate and spokesperson,.

I have every possible variation of Alexa, 13 total even kickstarter devices that have not even hit the market yet. Alexa has become a routine part of my life in my home, at work, even in my car over the last 2.5 years. I really hesitated on buying the Spot after my disappointment with preordering the Echo Show (I gave it a 3 star rating). After watching the reviews and and interacting with people that owned the Spot I took the plunge and received my device today.

I won't waste anyone's time explaining what Alexa can or can not do. At this point everyone either owns an Alexa device or knows someone with one. I will warn you though that purchasing an Alexa device is like a gateway drug, You will be buying more and will find yourself investing in smart home devices and accessories.

Setting up the Spot was easy in fact I did most of it from the Alexa app before my Spot arrived. As soon as I plugged it in I was prompted to connect to my wifi. I easily typed in the password from the Spot's touch screen and was instantly synced with my other Alexa devices. All I had to do was some simple customization from the app and device once I received it. I wish that Amazon would give us complete control on the touch screen devices rather than still depending on an app for set up.

The only thing I actually couldn't figure out how to do on my own was set reoccurring alarms. Ironic since it's an alarm clock. To set a reoccurring alarm you say repeat alarm specific day of the week and time. This is great because my schedule changes every day. My alarm clock only let me set a weekday and weekend alarms with the same time on the week day or weekend. However the downside is if you wake up every day at the same time you still have to set a repeating alarm for every day of the week. Once the alarms are set you can fine tune them from the Alexa app. I wish it could all be controlled from the Spot's touch screen.

I was hoping for a larger variety of Alarm tones than what the other Echo devices already had, but that's not the case with the Spot. If you already own an Alexa device you can preview all the different alarms from the app.

Reviewers have complained about the size of the digits for reading the time being too small. I found this to be untrue. I could easily make out the time from 12 feet away. Also if you have poor vision, or let say take your glasses off and can't see at night you don't even have to open your eyes to find out what time it is. Just ask Alexa what time is it? Some reviewers have said that the Spot doesn't support bluetooth, that's also untrue.

I don't think that the sound is much louder than an Echo Dot, it is much richer and has more bass making it sound better. I wish Amazon would create an adjustable equalizer in the app or on the touch screens of their capable devices.

One thing I do not like is if I am using my fire stick connected to my Spot by default all viewing commands go straight to the fire stick.  I can't watch a Prime movie and use my Spot at the same time. The Spot will use my commands to control my firestick.

The dimming feature is much better than any alarm clock I've ever owned. Aesthetically the device looks very good, the resolution and display are vibrant, the touch screen is smooth and responsive.

The sound quality in comparison would be 2nd Gen Echo > Echo Show > 1st Gen Echo > Spot > Dot.

Loudness 1st Gen Echo > 2nd Gen Echo > Echo Show > Spot > Dot. So for volume and quality of sound the Spot sits in the exact same place 2nd to last. It's also worth noting that despite that it's the second most expensive variation of Alexa excluding the Fire 10 HD with hands free Alexa.

I kind of wished I would have bought another Echo Show for my bedroom when they were on sale for $149, but now that I have the Spot I can see why it makes sense having one in my bedroom instead of another Echo Show. It's great having all of the features of an Echo Show on a compact device that is visually more appealing and doesn't crowd my nightstand.

If I had to choose only one Echo device the Spot wouldn't be it for me. However if you are already invested in the Alexa ecosystem the Spot makes a great addition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A smart night stand clock, and more. However, must ""purchase"" the full user manual.","February 19, 2018","Love these SPOT's. White version is my favorite. I traded in my echo DOTS (eBay) for these SPOTS from Amazon. Bought 4 of the SPOT's to replace my 4 DOTS.
Sound from the spot is much better than the dot. Louder and more bass. Setup was easy and the clock faces are fun and many to chose from. The one digital face goes into a orange digital time color when in night mode. Looks nice.
I asked the spot to play a movie and it picked a random movie selection on its own, can zoom to full screen but most of the movie is naturally clipped. Problem then was, what command to use to get the spot to STOP playback???
I had to FF the movie to its end to get back into clock mode.
There is a user manual available on Kindle books store but a paid subscription is required to view the full SPOT manual. NOT NICE AMAZON.
The user manual should be free to all SPOT registered owners, in all fairness.
I was a fan of the defunct SONY DASH, the internet connected clock, weather station, news device. Then Sony quit support of their DASH (bad decision Sony) and until the Amazon SPOT came along there was no replacement for the sony dash. The amazon SPOT is much better than the dash, with more advanced technology naturally. I guess the Amazon SHOW is more the size of the dash but the SPOT is spot on.
The drop-in feature works nicely but can be disabled if desired. I like dropping in on other SPOT's in the home to communicate with family in other rooms of the house. Or to see if I left the TV on, lamp on, etc. Would like to try drop-in with other SPOT's outside of the home but no one else that I know has a SPOT. They don't know what they are missing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's a standard Echo with a decent speaker - not as good as the full-size Echo, but better than a Dot. However, there's a problem. Amazon did a horrendous job on the clock faces. There are a few to choose from both analog and digital and all of them are very hard to read and lack information like the date or temperature outside.
The analog clocks also suffer from having hour hands that are very, very thin and extremely hard to read at night.
The backgrounds that Amazon put on the clocks are just poor. All they do is make it even harder to read the time.
Amazon - here's a hint. Black background large clock numbers and perhaps the date and temperature in a smaller font.
Update 1/28/18 - Amazon has added some additional clock faces - they're getting better, but still not there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “Alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having Alexa repeat “OK alarm set for 5am.”  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I’m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I’m in the shower.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_368?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=368&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We're happy we did. It's easy to set multiple alarms and separate alarms for weekday/weekend, which is cool. And since the music is delivered wirelessly, there's no problem with static-y FM reception.
For now we have Amazon Music (introductory offer), which is very nice. But we don't have Amazon Prime and don't plan to get it, and we haven't decided whether paying $9.99/month for Amazon Music is worth it. We'll see.
The only deficiencies so far are in instructing Alexa -- I need to specify when I want the alarm (days of week, time), that I want music to wake me (and not an alarm), which channel/station, and (which I haven't figured out how to ask) the music volume. All without a pause for breath (which Alexa interprets as the end of the voice command).

Ok. Maybe not, but pretty close! Funny, but I find that if I’ve had a day off work and no company, just Alexa’s (and a guinea pig) around me all day, my voice starts sounding robotic...hmmmm...

I live in a 1 bedroom studio apartment. So, who needs FIVE echos in three rooms total in maybe a 500 sq foot space??? Apparently, me...

I have three dots, one echo plus, a spot, and I just ordered another spot...I have way too much fun...and no place to put them all!

So, my first Alexa device was the dot. I love her. She traveled with me everywhere (until I got a kindle fire with, of course, Alexa...). Then I moved into an apartment with more than one room. Aaaakk!!! Now I’m too far away from Alexa DOT when I’m in my den, but I NEED her in my bedroom too! So, that’s when Alexa mama (Plus) joined the family. They like talking to each other. Then, OH MY WORD! AUDIBLE MEMBERS COULD GET A DOT FOR A PROMO AT $25! well...hhhmm...you can’t have too many Alexa’s right? There’s always room for more members of MY Alexa family, even if there really aren’t more rooms. Heck, I’ll put her in the bathroom!!! PERFECT! My showers seem to be getting longer as she reads to me or sings to me...sigh...now I have to ask her to wake me up half an hour earlier in the morning!!!

So...then I’m still looking at Alexa devices, as if I actually NEED more (yes, I do...) and saw the spot on sale. Hhhmmmm.....should I? Shouldn’t I? I’ve been looking at the show, but it seemed to be more than I really needed (um, right, it’ll join the family eventually I’m sure). One of my biggest challenges with both Echo mama and her DOT babies is that I’m a very visual person. I retain info better when I can read or see it. So, I have felt like I haven’t been utilizing my other Alexas as much as I could for productivity purposes. I have a number if health conditions and a lot of the skills could really help me more if I could see them. Some aren’t optimized yet, but the real important ones are reminders, lists, and my calendar. Yes, I know I can pull those up in the Alexa app too, but I haven’t been remembering to use her for those things as much since I don’t see them pop up on a screen as I’m creating them, and don’t see them on a screen when I just ask her what’s coming up. So, I decided to try a spot to see if it would help me with certain things if I had an option of typing them in the screen on the device, reading things I have right on the screen, seeing my news feed topics on the screen, and seeing my news stations show up on the screen. It didn’t take long to realize how big of a difference this would make! So, one problem...I couldn’t decide if it would be better to keep the spot in my kitchen (I just used to use Alexa mama since it’s the same room, just across the room, but now I wanted to SEE recipes and other things I used to just yell across the room to Alexa mama from the kitchen). Or did I want the spot in my den, where I spend a lot of time and need access to calendars and reminders there too, but the speaker is better on Alexa mama...and I am usually on a device to use the app conveniently there to see what she’s saying...I’m not covered in kitchen goo. Plus, it’s a better place for my books and music to fill the whole apartment. No, wait, OH MY WORD! It’s bedtime!!! I need a spot in my room to watch my news feed in the morning before I get up half an hour earlier now because of her, see my reminders for the day, my schedule, etc...

So...the spot went from my kitchen, to my den, and ended up in my bedroom for the night, then back to my den in the morning, and back to my bedroom at night...

Needless to say...I got a second spot while it was still $20 off...we will now have five Alexas...and yes, they are all Alexa...like John Jacob jingleheimer Schmidt. For some reason, I can’t call them Amazon, Echo, or computer...

So, in my UNBIASED opinion of another Alexa...because, you know you shouldn’t show favoritism towards any family members...I ADORE the spot. Sure, the screen size is smaller than the show, which is one Alexa device I haven’t tried yet, but it suits what I need right now and, honestly, the space I have to put it. I think it has great sound, clear picture, and was really excited to SEE pictures of the recipes when I asked for one today. I live on recipe apps, and the default one she accessed is one of my faves where I’ve saved A LOT in the past, so I’m really excited to see them show up on the screen! That wasn’t something I was expecting. The spot, like the other Alexa devices, could do even more and I know as she keeps learning and developers build skills to support the visual features of the show and spot, they will continue to get even better and better, but I’m very pleased with this spot and can’t wait to discover new features and see what my family will be able to do down the road! I love my Echo and dots, and the spot takes the Alexa devices up another notch, IMO, for a reasonable price! Now, I just need to add more rooms to my apartment somehow so each Alexa has her own room...

Just one suggestion for Echo developers...it WOULD be nice to be able to customize names more, like you can customize the groups for smart devices. As much fun as it can be to have several talk to each other, it can also be kind of annoying if the wrong one gets the signal and the wrong one (or all) respond...kind of like when your mom accidentally calls out the name of every child except the one she means to call...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I do not recommend this as an alarm clock. You must go through app on your phone each night to reset recurring alarms. Because if you swipe the screen as it says, it turns off the alarm for the next days. You can, speak to Alexa to turn off alarm but who wants to speak so early in the morning.  Also, the small circular screen is pretty much useless except as a clock. And since the alarm clock function is almost useless, the clock function isn't really needed either. Stick with the Echo Dot, much cheaper and does all the same things.

It replaced an old clock/radio that wasn't the easiest to read at a distance at night.  The simple modern design matches well with our furnishings.

We also got the Echo Connect which allows us to use the Spot as a phone and eliminates the need for one in the bedroom.  We did get the stand which is pricey for a piece of plastic - but it does make it easy to adjust the angle so you can read from a distance.

We wake up to ""daily news briefs"" which is really nice to know what is going on around the world each morning and have the weather update before we head off to work daily. I like that it's not too bright and doesn't keep us awake at night. It doesn't take up as much room as our old radio alarm clock and hey, it adjusts the time itself. I really like that!

 I feel of the sound from the second generation Dot is better than this spot.
The dot & the show have way better microphones also.
 The spot usually doesn’t hear me and I have to raise my voice, even in a quiet room.
My biggest pet peeve is the screen never blacks out after a certain amount of time like the show.

 Do I need the screen on 24 hours a day just to see the time for total of maybe one minute today ?

I don’t like the screen on at night I would rather ask the time, let it tell me the time to go back to bed in darkness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Spot-Smart-Alarm-Clock/product-reviews/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_86?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=86&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The additional visual features have me engaging the Spot to watch the response. I like seeing the scores as she reads them out and the weather is eye catching too. This might be because it is a new addition and perhaps my usage will drop as become accustomed to the video features. We shall see.
