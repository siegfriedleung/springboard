Also, with the second generation model came new software features, like Hulu video.

I purchased the first gen show last year and to be honest It became a music player with a screen. Minus the occasional video call with someone else, that was it's primary use. The screen was pretty small in comparison to the second model and I never would have considered watching anything on it.

The second generation feels like a small TV (requires Hulu w/live TV) in my kitchen on top of being an Alexa / music device.

It also just looks much nicer on my kitchen counter","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First issue, without a smartphone, he couldn't set it up. In fact you have to have a cell number to link the account to. Okay, did that but I have had so many issues getting it to connect. For some reason, I always have to repeat his name; adding contacts is convoluted: adding a neighbor -- we set up the Alexa app on the neighbor's telephone and I confirmed it is working from there. Can't add the neighbor as a drop-in allowed contact.

This product is too difficult to set up and use. I have been with support multiple times. Perhaps I have too many Amazon devices and it gets confused but use case is simply an Amazon Fire Tablet with Echo Show base and this Echo Show and I can't connect with any consistency. Good idea but needs to be simplified to work and set up. One should be able to set it up on EITHER phone or PC web page. There needs to be consistency between alexa.amazon.com and the app as far as contacts are concerned or it needs to propagate immediately. Users shouldn't have to have to install alexa app to use the device. Or if they do, then at least make it easy without needing double identification setting up the app. This device is just too confusing for the average person to set up (and I would consider myself especially tech savvy).","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is our first experience with the Echo Show since we didn't pick up the first generation.  Luckily though I didn't miss out on the newest version since my wife surprised me with the preorder a couple days ago and man am I impressed with it.
We have ours in the bedroom, it serves as our alarm, smart TV, voice assistant and smart speaker. Everything it was meant for. I could see it being used in a kitchen setting too if you've used Alexa to help with cooking.
We have several Echo devices around the house including the Echo Plus in our living room where we started our smart home experience. The Echo Plus has some great sound quality don't get me wrong, but the Show definitely is the better sounding system.  Adding this bad boy to our inventory of Echo devices was a great choice.

The speakers on the echo show V2 sound fantastic with the bass produced quite literally astounding. I did have to turn the bass down just a tad to stop slight distortion at 100%. Otherwise i have clear, crisp audio on full blast with bass that easily fills a room. The large screen and amazon music are magic with lyrics scrolling across the very nice 720p display. The cooking capabilities are awesome and the ability to control my hue smart bulb lights using the built in zigbee hub is awesome! The screen although beautiful seems to be where amazon may have cheaped out or i may have just been very unlucky. I had my show running for a solid two weeks and sadly the screen couldn't keep up. I came home from work only to find long streaks going across my echo screen. For a device that is meant to be on 24/7 you'd think a better more reliable panel would've been installed. To make matters worse the policy for replacement is a joke. I called and was polity greeted to being told i'd have to send it in for repair rather than what I had expected. What should've happened is i should've had a new show sent out with prime shipping and a return label for the defective one. I understand that people lie to get a second product but that is where the customer would be charged for the second product upon failure to send back the defective one.

This is sad considering many media sources and reviews touted the port as a feature.

Since countless reviews have focused on the big and beautiful screen, my comments are added here:
1. No doubt this is a gorgeous screen. The small clock typeface has been fixed, although much to my surprise, there is little to no clock customization. Worse, the only background ""themes"" are the simplistic (and very tiring) ""illustrations"" and no background at all. What happened to the wonderful photos I have on my Show 1st Generation? This is Amazon's star product; I would have expected all kinds of new customization features and details. I settled for my folder ""Album"" of various photos that I have in my Amazon Photos app. Just say ""Alexa, add this album to my background"" and they will cycle every 1 minute or so (and no, there does appear to be any way to cycle these any faster...). Any yes, as another reviewer stated, an entirely different background pops up with an ad or notification.
2. The loud Alexa voice has been fixed I have read. I don't really like the side and rear speaker placement however - poor Alexa sounds as if she is within a box. The sound is indeed louder with an accentuated bass (and a three-level equalizer, woohoo!) but the music is missing a clear location. It sounds diffuse and non-distinct.
3. The worst surprise was this irritating screen-goes-blank after 2 minutes feature, which is carried over from the 1st Generation. Why does this happen? I can no longer see lyrics or title or the art after the screen dies. Arrgghh.
4. No Youtube. We all know why but that doesn't make it any better. And no, the Silk/Firefox work-around is just stupid. Just make up (Google and Amazon) and bring the native YouTube back!

In retrospect, I'm glad I have them both. The 2nd Generation will take over the kitchen and the 1st Generation goes with me to work.

Why all the critical comments despite the 4-stars? Because the new Echo Show is placed right next to my Lenovo Smart Display, which has a seamless Youtube and great sound/screen as well. The 2nd Generation Echo Show is just so much nicer than the Smart Display which was one of the biggest disappointments for me in 2018.

Amazon can quickly fix most of all these nit-picking comments in future updates. Give us more customizations in the GUI (backgrounds, themes, clock styles like the Echo Spot), fix the blank-screen irritation, and PLEASE bring back Youtube!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen is gorgeous and the sound is incredible.
I received this device a couple of days ago and hadn't yet gotten around to installing it.
On this Saturday afternoon, I was in a Genisis mood. I asked Alexa to play Second Home by the Sea on my Everywhere group (which includes my original model Echo in my bathroom and the newest generation Echo in my kitchen and the newest generation Echo Dot in my laundry room.
Never a surprise, everything sounded wonderful.
Then I decided to dig in and install the new Show.
The installation was falling down easy. I had also purchased the adjustable stand, which was a cinch to attach to the new device. I went through the obligatory first-boot software upgrade and after a few minutes, my Alexa website interface was communicating with my new Show and I was able to alter my everywhere group to include it.
I played the same song. It was amazing. Fans of Genisis know that it is bass-intensive. This new Show thumps quite well for a device of its size.
I look forward to deregistering my old Show to gift it to a friend at work.
This upgrade is outstanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Since chat is currently one of the few apps that allows group video chat, I thought I could chat with her and others at same time via the Echo Show. However please note that group chat via Skype on the Echo Show does not work. Only worked when did person to person video call. I feel there should have been some mention that if Echo supports Skype it does so without full features. I submitted a question before buying but nobody knew the answer to I'm writing this review to save others the need to buy then return.

Also not while the device itself is nice (big screen and great speakers) the software takes no advantage of having a screen for input purposes. You control this completely by saying ""okay alexa"" which for me personally isn't ideal. Also there were suggested videos that you had limit control over and really didn't want to see. Overall, they could have made a much better device if the software was applied differently on many fronts.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The majority of all functions will only give you an audio response only, even if there easy to find corresponding video available from the same sources the Echo Show is pulling from -- news briefing from different media outlets, as an example.  For video streaming, the big players either aren't available or require jumping through several hoops in order to get them to function. If you'd like to utilize the device as a digital picture frame, you're able to use Amazon Photo -- a thing no actually uses as far as I can tell -- but unable to link the device to any image services or accounts which people actually use.

Most of my gripes there aren't necessarily Amazon's fault as other companies are certainly under no obligation to create skills linking to their services for the Echo Show, particularly when many of them are direct competitors of Amazon and their services. It's unfortunate and frustrating, but it is what it is.

My main complaint is one which Amazon has no one to point a finger at but itself: The screen is 10"" worth of unused space 90% of the time, with only 1/12 of the area being used to display the sort of information you'd want at a glance on an always-on display. It shows you the current time and temperature, but there is currently no way to customize or add additional information. Not the current day or date, upcoming scheduled appointments, particular stocks, moon cycle or whatever other info you might want at a glance.

To repeat, this $230 always-on display does not allow you to have the current day or date displayed. You need to ask Alexa to tell you this information. There is less information display on a 10"" display than what is offered on the ~1"" screen of you smartwatch of choice. There is no way to customize this information. This is less functionality than your average digital clock. To add insult to injury, apparently the ability to display the current day and date IS available on the Echo Spot for $100 less.

This may seem to a minor issue, and largely I think it is. But it speaks to the sort of decisions -- or lack thereof -- being made with this device as a whole. Amazon hit gold with the original Echo and decided to slap a screen on it, but don't seem to know what to do with the screen, even when it comes down to the most basic functionality.

 If these sort of things are added in a future update, I will happily change this review.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Used the Amazon trade-in program (with my 1st gen Echo Show), which worked exceptionally well.  As for the new one, I have it in my kitchen on the breakfast bar.  And yes, with speakers in the back, it does need an open area so sound isn't muffled - no big deal IMHO. The screen size, sound, and color are superb.  It certainly dims well at night, so believe it would work fine in a bedroom.  Although some folks have entered negative comments about the various banners that come across the screen, I love them - they give me ideas about how to better use my Echo Show, as well as catching headlines and trending topics that I'd never think to ask about.  As a Prime member, I can easily stream music from Amazon.  Also, yes, the Echo Show can stream SiriusXM, which I have.  All you need is to pay for Internet streaming from SiriusXM and enable the skill for Alexa.  Works great (although you won't see any info about the song or artist, which does show up on regular SiriusXM device screens).  I use my Echo Show not only for music but to search for recipes, get the news and weather, change channels on DirectTV, call friends and family that also have Alexa devices, etc.  Very versatile!

The only thing I can complain about the Hulu app so far is that I don't seem to see a way to choose an episode for a series.  It picks up where it's left off.  Even asking Alexa for a specific season and episode, it will only play the next one to be watched.
Other than that, it's great.  The sound is loud enough where I can hear it over fans and vents while cooking in the kitchen.

Logitech Hub & Harmony Elite remove have worked perfectly since we set them up 2 years ago. The instructions on the Alexa app say to down load the Harmony app, sync it to  the hub, then add to Alexa app. That's it. I download the Harmony app, it works with all the devices we have attached perfectly, I sync it to the Alexa app, no errors, Alexa doesn't recognize any of the Activities that are in the Harmony App, not a single one. I don't know where to begin to trouble shoot this mess and I can't find anyone to call to help.
So far the only things connected to Alexa are 1 plug and 1 light bulb.
Also, if I had know I'd have to download an app for everything and connect the apps I would have re-thought the whole thing. What happens if I leave the house with my phone and mu husband wants to turn a light off? Is Alexa taking his command, using my phone data plan to  send it to the Alexa app on my phone, have Alexa on my phone connect to the app that actually controls the light and sending the proper response back to Alexa in my house to turn off the light?? do I have to load all the apps I loaded on my phone on his phone too??
And again, where do I go to get answers to my questions?

I originally had it this review at 3 stars for that issue but now that it's fixed I am updating the review to 5 stars. The sound quality and microphone are way better than the first gen echo show. And the 2nd gen echo show works perfectly with other smart devices that are alexa ready. I have a harmony hub that controls my oscillating fan and my whole home theater system, 8 philips hue light bulbs that have a bridge, a leviton smart light switch, and a ecobee 3 smart thermostat all that the echo show 2nd gen works perfectly with. For my philips hue lights I have different groups for each room they are in set up in my alexa app and I can have alexa turn on/off each group of philips hue lights one group at any time I want and she will do it perfectly. I have the leviton smart light switch set up to control my florescent lights in my kitchen and connected to my echo show 2nd and alexa turns them on/off perfectly.

After troubleshooting with Amazon  we returned the original 2 Echo Shows and received 2 new devices in a timely manner (easy return and shipping of the original Echo Show). Happy with the devices but within days my Echo Show started having the same issues as previously mentioned (no issues thus far with my mother's device). Not sure if I need to return both and call it a loss or request another replacement. As a side note, I paid $229 for each and now see Prime Members pay $179.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_66?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=66&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Ordered it via the Amazon mobile app, it was on sale for $179, I was prompted to trade in my 1st Gen Echo Show for $45 and then received an instant $30 gift card making the total investment $113 I originally wanted the Apple HomePod, but at $350 plus AppleCare and taxes, $400 was just too much for me to consider investing in a smart speaker.

The screen quality and video clarity are also good.
The bad: It takes far too long to update. For example, when you put your calendar events on your home screen, it is usually 12-24 hours behind, showing you yesterday's events. Same goes for notifications. Received an Amazon shipment and my Echo notified at 10:16am, it wasn't till 10:56am that my Echo Show gave me that info.
The ugly: Home screen just isn't actually prepared to display properly. If connected to your calendar, it will only show one even for the day, rather than scrolling through multiple events, requiring you to touch the screen to go into your calendar (at that point I could just be using my regular Echo device). Headlines/stories are completely random, and cut off mid sentence. So you'll see something like ""Snakes loose in the wester"" and again would have to touch the screen to dig in further. It also seems to have a much harder time hearing me that my regular Echo devices, especially if it's playing music! Additionally, it simply isn't designed to be seen from across the room; I have a small city apartment so at most I'm 10 feet away, the time and weather are tiny little dots in the corner of a an otherwise empty screen, and there's no way you'll be able to read the ""try"" scroll on the bottom of the screen unless you're right on top of it.

Unless you are using this for the specific purpose of video chatting with someone else who has an Echo Show, I'd say save your money till they make the adjustments. With Google Home Hub (which unlike the Echo Show has the ability to search and play YouTube videos) only costing $150, and regular Echo devices at $100, this just feels like a missed opportunity that is over priced, not prepared for a good user experience, and overall not worth the cost!","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

30 minute update: 2 stars to 1. A speaker just blew while playing at 50% volume. Absolutely  ridiculous.

Just received the new show, and not impressed. We have all of the other Echo products and this one is probably the biggest let down. The screen gets it the two stars, but the sound/speakers are a HIGE miss. Without front speakers it is just odd and very obvious the sound is being blocked by the screen.

In taking the smart home plunge, I ended up purchasing 4 Echo Shows (2nd generation) and 2 Facebook Portal+’s for my home because I wanted both, PA & Drop in function, but also a primo video chat. Here’s why I have both:

The Echo Show (2nd generation) exceeds the Portal + in overall functionality. It provides all of the features of the previous model and more. I wanted some (or all) of my primary devices to sometimes act as a PA & also be able to use the ‘Drop in’ feature when I am not home. I live in a condo and have an 8wk old puppy coming. Though I work from home, at some point if I need to go on a run or leave for an hour or two, I am still able to access the camera and speak to her if she’s barking at the front door. For now, Facebook Portal does not have this feature. With the Echo Show there is also no need for an external hub for most of my smart devices because it’s built right in. I’m unsure if Portal has this. With the Show, there is also direct access to the internet. Just ask Alexa to play movie trailers, Prime videos, etc. The display is nice, but I would chalk up the video calling and ‘Drop in’ quality to better than that of my security cameras (also high quality).

The Facebook Portal+ display and AI camera technology far exceeds that of any other device I’ve used. I purchased this for the calling feature - which is its’ primary function. During a call, you no longer need to employ being your own camera man during the call - it’s completely hands-free and smoothly follows you around the room like a movie director. I was impressed by the range at which it accurately followed me and will even follow in the direction of your voice if you happen to step out of the frame. Very limited on other functions though and I expect more are soon to follow within the year once the ‘data breach’ blah blah stuff calms down a bit. Though the Portal does not support the PA & ‘Drop in’ functions that the Echo Show has, I can still control all of my smart home devices & groups with ease and employ all of my routines with no problem.

If you’re looking for all-around functionality and more features the Echo Show (2nd) is the way to go. If quality video calling is the priority, then you can’t beat the Portal+ for now - it far exceeds everything else in that arena.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

As it is the echo show is limited in capabilities such as not being able to play Netflix, browsing capabilities. Everything you search on google takes you to an Amazon page. So forget trying to buy something elsewhere. It's the customers who buy these devices who suffer. Pretty sad when you pay for something and are short changed because of a squabble between 2 corporations. Then there is the fact of learning to use it. A manual in the form of a downloadable pdf file would help immensely. Hopefully they will upgrade and improve this device so it is compatible with and will play well with services other than Amazon. Otherwise I would consider buying other devices. It has some nice features and the sound is good but it could be so much better. For that reason I feel Amazon is making a mistake in not bringing this product to it's full potential. People will buy Google Home Hub, Facebook Portal, Lenovo Smart Display and others if Amazon doesn't get wise.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The touchscreen is good and I suppose you could use it to stream shows but we mostly just use the show for music and to answer trivia.

Beasom","Great device, but background pictures continue to freeze or not cycle","February 11, 2019","These devices are great.  I own two of them.  The display is sharp looking and the sound quality is fantastic.  As a digital picture frame they are terrible.  The problem even occurs on the gen 1 Echo show.  I am talking about the background picture display and NOT the slideshow mode that is also possible on these devices.
For the background, I choose a folder of pictures from Prime Photos.  It cycles the photos every 90 seconds or so while showing the overlays I have selected (weather, drops ins, sports scores) and also transitions between the Amazon trending topics.  At least once a week, it will get stuck on a picture and never change it unless I power cycle.  Also, when it gets to the last photo in the album, it will usually just go back and show the last 10 pictures again, rather than start back over at the beginning.
I have contacted Amazon product support about this and they ignored me.  I am not a software engineer, so perhaps programming for pictures is a very difficult thing.  It is possible though, as I've seen other devices do it.  I would also like to see some options for the background pictures, such as picture duration/speed and a shuffle option.  This request to Amazon has fallen on deaf ears too.  Maybe they just don't care.
I have tried about everything I can to fix this/trick it to work and have not had luck.  Others I know have the same issues with background pictures.  I would use the slideshow mode, but it doesn't display any overlays or additional information.  If Amazon would fix this I would give it a higher score.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought the bundle that included Hue light bulbs as it’s advertised as being able to directly control the bulbs without need for the Hue Bridge/Hub.  But to do this you must enable the Hue skill by linking accounts.  So you go to setup a Hue account but that requires the Hue Bridge.  So you just try to link using the Alexa app....and are told it can’t find the Hue Bridge.  So a big fat waste of $50 for bulbs you can’t use as promised.

Much larger screen, which looks great. Very bright, good color, all as expected. It looks nicer as well. This device is larger and heavier. The sound is much improved in terms of the speakers, drivers, etc. and it has bass response the 1st gen Echo could not dream of. All in all, much as presented here on Amazon.

As expected, there are some software issues and omissions. It's a new release, after all. So I'm sure Amazon will be fixing these soon.  Many have noticed the LOUD Alexa voice response. It is truly annoying. Hopefully, they will fix this soon. Ideally they would let you set Alexa's voice response level independently from media. As it is, media volume is much lower.

Also, they appear to have used spatial processing to give you a stereo effect and it works great. But it's not always desirable. There should be an option to disable it. For example, it works great for some music, but not well at all for other music.  Also, the bass response is overdone - for some things - even when I lower the bass in the equalizer to minimum levels. The equalizer adjustments need more range or tweaking, in my opinion.  At first I thought, wow, I won't need my external speakers now, This thing sounds great. But as I went on, I soon learned that wasn't the case and reverted back to using my Bluetooth speaker. The spatial effect interference with mid-range (vocals) is the primary reason as it alters the balance of sounds, but the over-done boomy bass is also an issue. It's less of an issue at lower volumes.

Some music sounds great. And movies I watched from Prime Video all sounded very good. With movies the bass and spatial sound works very well and everything sounded fantastic. It made for a very enjoyable movie experience.

I was a beta user for the original Echo and we went through some of this with that device as well and Amazon did a great job of addressing the issues, so I am sure they will do the same this time around. The hardware is a huge step up in performance, so the results should be excellent.

So vastly improved screen and sound drivers, they just need to get the software tweaked for music. Also, as some have noted, not all of the functionality is working properly at this point. Most all of the basic stuff does. Some  things still have glitches. But give them time.

I will try to come back and update as things unfold. Giving 4 stars for now as I like it even with the glitches.

Update:After lowering the bass (a lot) and moving the Echo to another location, sound has improved.  Still would like finer controls, but it definitely has great sound potential. Some songs sound incredibly good. The spatial effect can be very enjoyable with the right source material.  Also, as mentioned, it works extremely well with most movies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Huge, High Def screen, great sound, etc.  The only negative is - we're still waiting for fun exciting things to do with it.  We hooked it up with LifX lights, Ring doorbell and cameras, and the new Amazon plugs.  All that is great, you can turn things on and off, but with the exception of the Ring video, not much needs the beautiful screen.

We use it to video chat with the kids & grandkids, and I think the stationary, hands free Echo is better for video chat than having to hold a phone.

You can watch prime on it. It will display your calendar, events, reminders, and smart home display is also a lovely feature. I have ring cameras and I’m abale to view each one on the show. One area that could use improvement is entertainment. Amazon currently only has one option for live tv which is Hulu. I know they are intergrating an app for prime on xfinity devices.

Bigger screen is a huge plus.  Speaker sound quality is much better than the 1st gen.  I paired mine with the Alexa Sub woofer and have good all around sound, but not quite bose quality.

I tried bluetooth pairing with an AIWA speaker and the functionality was awkward.  It would play music through the AIWA at one point and no other sounds would play, such as Alexa responding.  When it finally connected with Alexa responding and music then I would get a thump out of the AIWA speaker every several seconds.  If you are looking for the sound quality as I was, I highly recommend considering the Alexa sub woofer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_27?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=27&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The echo show is just OK. I bought this to replace our original echo and I really don't think it sounds as good. I have played a lot with the equalizer to try and make it sound better but still has a funny bass sound and just doesn't sound like I would like it. It doesn't sound bad just not as clear as I had hoped.
I was also hoping that it would also do better at picking up voice commands but does about the same as the old unit. The addition of the screen is nice sometimes but not as much as I was thinking. It can also be very distracting for little kids that tend to be drawn to screens. I am always telling the unit to turn off the screen.
Probably the most annoying thing is the volume control. It would be nice if it could normalize the volume. Different apps YouTube, Amazon music, etc. all play at different volumes. You also can not control the volume of her voice separately from the main volume. So if you have to turn up the volume high to hear a video on YouTube or another app the voice volume is crazy loud. It would be nice to have a system (voice) volume control separate from the main volume. Maybe this will be fixed with an system update or something in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love that it engages you throughout the day by adding interesting facts and new stories that show up on the screen.  However I have to remove a star for the same reason.  Let's say that Alexa shows a fantastical story about a huge banana someone has sculpted and it made headlines all over the world.  When you ask her to tell you about it, she reads the story but there is no true picture of the object in question.  Instead, you get to see a regular banana instead.  The name is Echo SHOW.  Please show me what you are talking about.  The video quality is pretty good when talking to others in different rooms and the recognition of voices is better than other Echo units.  For instance, the Echo Show in the basement will sometimes answer me at the same time as the Echo show upstairs.

I thought a screen could ""screen"" almost anything - nope.  Even though others have reviewed the limitations of the show, it was difficult for me to picture how a device so beautiful could be so useless for streaming video.

I can't get flash and netflix to work on it through chrome. This means I can't get my cable tv and online dvr to play from the xfinity website on this device. I just don't see how I can use this unless I fork over hundreds of dollars to purchase prime videos and tv. Even though I have prime and the first season of a show is listed as free - the show told me I needed to go to the webiste and pay for the tv show in order to watch it.

So, if you are happy watching whatever show manges to scrounge up for you or you really want this for video conferencing/camera monitoring, I would give this a hard pass. Yes, the sound is decent but I tried placing mine against a wall (normal) and the sounds is awful and bounces of the wall. This really needs to be placed a couple of feet away from a wall. Incidentally, the stand you can buy for this fits perfectly and works well.

You can’t just ask it to turn the volume down,  (Of course not, because that would make too much sense on a machine that’s designed for voice commands...) you have to walk across the room and press the buttons on the top of the device to do that.

The good stuff:

1. Easy to set up. I had the Show up and functional in under 15 minutes. It was already registered to me, all I had to do was rename it (based on the room I placed it in). Downloading the Alexa iPhone app made setup even easier. Within about 30 minutes I had most of the home smart devices connected, included Nest devices and the SmartThings hub.

2. Good sound. I don't think it will compete with a Sonos or the new Apple Homepod, but the sound is good, and for most applications, more than good enough.

3. Very nice to have the calendar and other life-organizing items pulled in from Google and other sources to show on the screen.

4. Does a nice job showing recipes.

5. It will read your kindle books to you.

The bad stuff:

1. Alexa doesn't handle names very well. And, if you have names in SmartThings that weren't fully thought out, you may run into a few problems. To clean up the labels for a voice-activated environment, I had to carefully rename a number of items and groups, ensuring that no words overlapped. That can be a challenge with multiple Hue lamps and other smart devices in the same room. Naming the lamps kitchen 1, kitchen 2, and kitchen 3 works great, until you also want a group called Kitchen Lights.... Same for the porch lights, and so on. In the end, I've renamed almost every device with some name that is not directly overlapping with the group I want it in (usually a group will be a room).

2. The device sits with the screen, and the camera, at an angle. This is OK if you are reading a list, but not so great if you want to use DropIn either as an intercom, or to check on your home while you are away. As I mentioned in my Echo Spot review, mostly you get a great view of the ceiling. For the hefty price take (about $220) the device should allow adjustment of the camera angle.

3. The unit is made to sit on a surface, a shelf or a counter. It would be great to be able to wall mount it, but that won't happen without some special hardware.

One other item to discuss: all Alexa devices require a login. You can login with the same account on all of them, which solves some problems, but causes others. I have a wife and two kids. Alexa assumes everyone is me, because I logged in with my Amazon account on all the devices. So? It means the reminders are mine, the alarms are mine, the calendars are mine... all my stuff on every device.

Amazon, if you really want to make Alexa useful, you need to make Alexa family-aware. If my son updates the calendar on the Spot in his room, it should stay with him, and he doesn't need to know about my appointments. The Echo Show in the kitchen is a community device for the entire house, but the Spot or Dot on the nightstand should be much more personal, especially for alarms and calendars. And Drop In should work for all the devices, no matter who the device is personalized for.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This is a great kitchen companion. The screen is large enough to view from across the room. Before adding an ingredient to a dish, you can confirm the measurement without walking away from the stove, bowl, mixer e.t.c. It has great speakers so you can fill the room with sound as you prepare your gourmet dish. I am hesitant about putting it in the bedroom, video calling :). When I purchased my show, Amazon offered a free smart light bulb. I wish they would bring back that offer. Not that I would buy another show, but it might help others purchase one, if they were considering having a smart home.

Our household uses the devices on a daily basis. I was pretty excited about the possibility of the Echo show. We could use it in the kitchen for the family calendar! Or for recipes! Or maybe to watch a show! Oh the possibilities!

We bought their 2 for $120 off deal black Friday 2018. I was intending on giving one of the units to the in-laws for Christmas and putting the other in our kitchen. The in-laws were wanting something that showed a nice big clock with the date and day of the week (among other things). I figured that the show would definitely be able to do that! Turns out I was sorely mistaken. The clock is a small little thing in the top corner that is not customizable at all. No date, no day of the week.

But hey, at least it has a calendar right?.. that is essentially useless. It only shows one or two days, or not even a day if you have multiple things on the calendar. It doesn't even highlight what the current day it is! There is no monthly or weekly view, just a extremely zoomed in view of 1 or two appointments. There is no option to customize anything. You get what you get. Why would you have a calendar without a week/month view?

We also were thinking it would be great for recipes. Turns out that because I'm in Canada, close to none of the 'standard' skills even work. Amazon has geolocked the recipes skill!?!? Ok, so no problem we can't use the recipes skill that is advertised clearly on the side of the box. I'll get over that and use the browser to show a recipe. So, I opened up the browser to a recipe site and started cooking dinner. After a couple minutes, the device times out and returns to the home screen! ""Alexa, reopen my browser"" should get me back to the page I was on right? No! It takes me back to the home page and I have to navigate to the recipe again. Rinse and repeat every two minutes until I give up and open up a physical cookbook.

EVERYTHING that I wanted to do with this device doesn't work. No clock, no calendar, no recipies, no netflix, no <insert whatever you think it will do here>. I'm sure that all these things will all get addressed in time,but right now it really falls short.

I gave this 3 stars because the actual physical product is excellent. Quality is great, speakers sound really good, screen is bright. I have no complaints about anything physical on the device. It really is a very nice physical product, but the firmware is close to completely useless for anything that I want to do with it. I will most likely return the units I bought. Maybe I'll buy them again once they have addressed some of the things that would actually make this useful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I haven’t figured out the audio setting but it has too much bass for my liking.

It doesn't seem to respond to inquires or commands quite as easily as my echo dots for some reason. I bought it bundled with a Ring Doorbell 2 and wanted to be able to quickly see who was at my door while in my family room. The problem I've had is with placement. The tables are on the sides of the couches and chairs, so the device is not facing me or others, which is likely part of the problem with the response. There's no convenient place to put it...certainly not like I see people making these things work easily in commercials. I still like it a lot.

We’ve had it for three weeks. Our main takeaways:
- The power of this device is multiplied if you are already an Amazon prime/unlimited user. Even if you are not, I would seriously consider becoming one as a prime membership costs more or less the same than services that give you a similar access to media on other platforms, but also comes with free shipping for amazon items and other perks such as photo backups on amazon photo etc.
- This device is amazing for music if you have a compatible subscription. Keep in mind that amazon prime already gives you access to many songs. With this device, when I subscribed to amazon music unlimited, an add on, it cost me 3.99/month (although that only gives you access to this service in this device). It can also connect your cell phone to play music you might have downloaded there, and is compatible with Apple Music. Sound quality is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors.
- We also use it to get our daily news brief. You can select your sources and we play it as we are getting breakfast ready, very useful.
- Has some other interesting uses, like coordinating shopping lists between multiple users through apps, as well as reminders and alarms.
- Great for cooking as well with full integration with Allrecipes and other recipe skills.
- It has some quirky interesting games as well, but this is not a defining feature for me.
- One area where it lacks compared to some of the competition is trip/drive planning. I have deducted one star for this. There is no embedded map feature that I could find. Others have this. It will however tell you how long it will take you to get somewhere, but in my experience even this is a work in progress with times being shown differing from what my phone shows me.
- Outisde of news videos, have not had a chance to test the movie feature. I have not seen a Netflix skill, although I have read Hulu is supported (have never tested it myself).

All in all, don’t regret the purchase at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Updated review after approximately six weeks of ownership with daily usage.

I had the first generation of this product and received this the day it was released.  I've used four of these Echo Shows daily.  I don't want to repeat the other great reviews on here so will try to add extra seven extra pieces information that may be helpful to you.

1) I wish Amazon and Google would band together and get over their silent feud.  I'm a huge fan of both companies (sorry Apple), but their products don't work well together.  After Amazon removed YouTube from the first generation product, I was more than upset.  Well, now you can get YouTube here via a workaround method.  You can use either Amazon's Silk Browser of the Firefox Browser on this device.  Neither works exceptionally well and I've found that Firefox works a little better, faster and with fewer hiccups.  So, you can get YouTube - just not on the YouTube native application.  It's not as good and linking your Google user account to the device and is much more difficult  to do.

2) It's difficult to get a Google-branded doorbell, the Nest thermostat or the Google camera to work with this device.  There are workarounds (many listed with a simple web search) that take a lot of time and technical knowledge to set-up, but everything seems like a workaround and isn't easy.  Amazon wants you to purchase their Ring doorbell, another thermostat brand (EcoBee), and Amazon-branded cameras.  This is very frustrating, to say the least.  I beta test Google Products and it's the same thing there.  Their new Google Home Hub doesn't support Amazon products well, but that's a different review for a different platform  Again, these two behemoth awesome companies need to come to terms and support each other's ecosystems.  I know it's a competitive ""thing"" that is supposed to benefit the shareholder via an increased profit margin.  However, as the consumer, this is a sore huge spot for me and I assume others?

3) I've used the drop-in feature from the Amazon Application on my phone to this device.  It's slow; painfully slow to connect and subsequently come into focus.  Moreover, the camera on this device shoots up the ceiling so you can't really see the entire room you've ""dropped-into"" well.  In order to see someone, they have to be directly in front of the device. Perhaps these are meant to be security/privacy features or are these just half-baked implementations?

4) I like that you can now issue a follow-up command to Alexa.  That is, you can program the device to listen to your request without saying the wake word ""Alexa"" again.

5) The user interface seems rudimentary. - almost like a pre-schooler designed it.  Sure the screen is larger, but simply displaying the weather, a clock or sports scores on a cartoonish-like background isn't enough.  I'd really like to see my Google doorbell and cameras as a default dashboard here without purchasing the Google Home Hub.  My hopes are this changes with future software updates.  Amazon: you employ some of the smartest talent in the world so please upgrade this simplistic screen interface.  It looks silly and very much like a Palm Pilot interface on the early 2000s.

6) Why oh why does Amazon Prime only display the last 60 shows in your library here?  You need to use the phone/tablet/computer application to see your entire library.  Amazon Prime shows are another fantastic thing about an Amazon membership, so why limit the ability to see a users' inventory?  Also, the volume on Prime video is much softer than when playing Amazon Prime music.

7) If you care about someone seeing your personal pictures, you can restrict access to your Amazon picture library,  That is, you can disable the picture feature on the settings menu via a toggle switch, the picture library comes ""ON"" by default.  So....if you have any compromising/private pictures uploaded from your phone automatically to the Amazon Cloud, you may not want them to display on your Echo device.

All-in-all, this is an incremental improvement over the original product with the best feature being the larger screen size.  The speaker sound is OK, but not fantastic as a few other reviews note and the sound is lower when using Amazon Prime video.  I'd like to see a better and more modern user interface and better ability to integrate with Google products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

First Alexa specific product. Love it!","December 21, 2018","I've been curious about these Echo products for a few years but we waited, hoping to let Amazon work out some of the security kinks first. I came across a great cyber Monday sale and so we decided to give it a try. I wanted this one specifically for my kitchen, for recipes and videos. I read up a lot on it in advance, how to speak to it etc. There is a definitely some training on both sides. I approached it with patience as I figured out the right way to ask it do what I wanted. My husband (who normally hates technology) quickly took to it and loved it.

It has a long way to go yet as far as being a bit more intuitive. There are moments I'm glad it has a screen, when it gets befuddled over ""return to the song"" (or something silly) I can just walk over and tap the screen to get what I want. Sometimes it trips over itself. But, I can have my hands in the oven and baking and ask ""Alexa, set timer for 6 minutes"" (you can set multiple timers with different names - whaaaat?) while I'm watching some random tv show or news, or listening to music. ""Alexa, how many tablespoons are in a half cup"" or ""...set a reminder pick up my prescription"", ""add garlic to my shopping list"" ""what's on my to do list for tomorrow?"" Catch my drift? I really have found it super handy.  I also listen to MORE music. I pay for Amazon music subscription but really only listened on my phone at the gym etc. Now on a whim, I find I come home from work and ask ""Alexa, play radiohead"" or something random while I'm taking off my coat, and voila! The quicker/easier access to music makes me utilize the service so much more.

I'm still a bit wary of the security, so I've left some things out. I didn't connect my contact list, as I wouldn't want an accidental call to go out to someone while we're having too many glasses of wine at 11pm. No one needs that. The drop in thing is no-go for me. I locked down as much as I could on that stuff. I like that there is a mute button I can press when I don't want her to listen, but we haven't used that as much as we thought we would. I've used it when talking ""about her"" to someone else on the phone (she kept piping into the conversation with her confusion, LOL. MUTE it Alexa.)

There's also a ton I still haven't tried. I haven't done any shopping on it. I haven't used it for smart home items. I haven't even used the Skype. And I STILL use it constantly and feel like its been impactful in our home.

All in all, a few gaps to work around so not nearly seamless, but otherwise, it's truly changed our kitchen experience for the better. So many neat little features. I rated it 5 stars based on how awesome this technology is and how great it is at some of these features. I was tempted to go 4 because it has so much further to go, but that didn't seem fair. It's a new technology. I grew up in a world before cell phones - so when I compare that and consider how far this has all come? 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Let me tell you that there is no Netflix, YouTube integration is subpar at best, integration with CNN is sad.  There is very little you can do interactively with the screen, I mean almost nothing.  Unless you need this for video calling (I have not tried that so that me be great) it is almost worthless.

Try ""Alexa, what can I make with spinach?""

The sound was decent and I had it hooked up to my Smartthings hub for full home automation.  However, I found myself migrating more and more over to the Google ecosystem and the Home hub devices.  When the 2nd Gen show came out, I decided to give it a try.  I was convinced that I was going to return it the next day.  Brought it home, set it up, did some research and found more about Hulu Live and it's integration with Alexa.  Connected my Ring doorbell and cameras ... the next day, I did go back to Best Buy - but I bought one more of the 2nd Gen Show's and two more of the Spot devices for my boys rooms.  I have disconnected all my Google devices and will be adding the 4k Fire Stick when it's released next week.  Absolutely love the 2nd Show and Spot devices.  The camera doesn't bother me at all because I have a $0.30 piece of plastic that is a lens cover like on my laptop - and when I am not using the camera, I slide that over the lens and no one can secretly watch us.  Love the drop in feature because I now placed one of these in my mom's house is up in age.  I will be disconnecting my cable subscription and using Hulu Live because I get all the local stations in addition to the cable channels that I use.  That will save me over $70 per month .. and I can watch on all my Fire Stick devices, Show's, etc.  Lastly, I did buy the Google Home Hub as well with the 7"" monitor ... that was the one I was convinced I would be using.  However, the sound is awful compared to the Show, it's tiny and if you want to watch any sort of videos on the screen - it sucks because it's so small ... I returned the Google Home Hub the same day it came in ... Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

With that said, the really annoying banners are a distraction, moreover actually annoying. There is no way (That I’ve been able to see) to disable them.

I purchased the product to use as I please, not rent it or leasing it to subject to see the display of things I didn’t ask for.

Video problem still on my device. Total of 8 devices in our family still having issue. Returning them does not fix it. I have done YouTube videos explaining the problem.

5 units in our family that do this. We have sent pictures and they still have not figured it out. My 3rd is on it's way I'll keep this review updated.
I have received my 2nd echo show 2nd generation due to faulty video on first one, after being in a call for an hour or so the screen turns black-and-white with lines through it you have to turn video off and back on to get it to be color again I returned the 1st one got the 2nd 1 and tonight the 2nd 1 did the same thing I am contacting them again I have no idea what to do. My daughters did same thing, we are both on our second unit.
Update..........been a week or so. Still getting black and white with lines periodically on my video to the caller while in a call. My daughter is on her 3rd Echo Show and hers is also still doing it.

On my original Show the screen would automatically go to sleep after several minutes.  If the 2nd gen has that setting I cannot find it.  The best I can find is to tell it to turn the screen off.  Why not a setting for sleep with several time options.  Last, my original show came with a very nice screen saver set of beautiful pictures from around the world.  The 2nd gen comes with a slide show of pastel water color type drawings or a blank gray screen.  There is an option to upload and create your own slideshow.  Why not at least give us the same as the 1st gen with additional options.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Kind of Underwhelming","January 21, 2019","Like the concept, but for me, its just another echo at a higher price. I have 3 echos, 6 Dots and a tap so I have experience with these products, but still find this one awkward to use. When you play a song, lyrics scroll. So if you like karaoke at hope, you'll like this. The connectivity with blink cameras (the reason I purchased) is underwhelming. I expected to see all 10 of my cameras on the screen, get alerts etc. Instead, no alerts and I have to ask for which camera I want to see, remembering all 10 names. So once I get an alert on my phone, I can then use the device to ask to see a live feed. I might just be an Alexa eShow dummy, but I liken this to my short lived Google Glass experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We're living in the future these things should be standard on items such as these.
The good,  speaker is the best as far as Alexa speakers go also best microphones she hears you loud and clear, the unit looks beautiful and everyone that sees it is amazed.

Unfortunately, the show falls short in this category, so I have returned my device.  For a device that has such a great video screen it seriously lacks support for video streaming.  There is no native support for YouTube, Netflix or any of the major streaming services, except Hulu.  You can access them through the Show's internet browser, but you can't use voice commands to do this, which completely defeats the point of having the Show.  Because of the limited streaming options that are available with voice activation I am giving the Echo Show only 2 stars.

If you want a device for your kitchen that will let you stream videos from your favorite services a better option would be to get a Kindle Fire HD 10 put it in Show mode and hook up some decent speakers or to get a small TV and attach a Fire TV Stick.

The sound quality is really good, but not as good as the Echo Plus.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The original show was pretty dated looking so I skipped it, but the (2nd gen) Echo Show looks so much better.

Software:
This is the biggest problem with the Echo Show so I'm leading with it. The software is really designed poorly. If it has a huge 10"" touch screen, why not design the software to let you use touch AND voice. Want to go to a website? You can't just click on a browser, you have to ask it to ""Open Firefox"" or ""Open Silk"". Want to quickly pull up a list of your timers currently running? You can't, you have to ask it. Want to search from a Prime Movie to watch while cooking? You have to do it with your voice and it's very cumbersome. If you're watching a video and want to set a timer, it closes out the video. When a timer is running, it's not always displayed, so you are left wondering how much time is left and have to ask her. When you use it as a photo frame (using the Prime Photos app on your phone or computer)  the photo you use is muted (no where near as nice looking as it is on the Google Home Hub) and it's constantly you to ""Try asking Alexa to...."". The whole thing is really poorly designed from a visual perspective. Thankfully that can be solved with software updates if Amazon tries.

Display:
The screen is beautiful and viewable from anywhere in the room. I find it to be a good size, in fact, it was one of the reasons I didn't go with the Google Home Hub. With a 7"" screen, that was just too small to be useful.

Sound:
It's a huge upgrade from my Echo Dot. It has a nice full sound and I rarely have the volume over 40%.

Voice Control:
It does a great job at hearing the call phrase ""Alexa"" from anywhere in the room and even in adjacent rooms

Overall, it's a good device with a lot of potential. Hardware-wise, it's top notch. Beautiful display, great sound, fits in well in a kitchen. The software is just lacking. You have to wonder if the people who designed it ever tried to use it on a regular basis. Hopefully they'll address those in future software updates.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen is a very high resolution, and the additional features on it are great. The voice recognition and ""listening"" features catch your wake command and questions very easily.

so, I’m not a huge fan of lets s do a review, but I wanted to share for others who are still trying to decide weather or not to sir d the money... WORTH IT!!!
Ok I’m like the smart home everything person. From Hue lights & plugs, to echo dots, microwave and prime tv etc etc
Now I have the echo show MERRY XMAS TO ME 😎
It was soooo soooo easy to install and it automatically picked up all my smart home devices and my WIFI
It immediately ran updates and works amazingly well.
So far it has not caused the TV to pause like the cube did. A small glitch I’m sure Amazon will remedy someday. I gave my cube as a gift. Cube is killer if that’s your only echo device. So, back to the show!! The sound is great & it’s BIGGER than I expected which is a BONUS!!! The graphics are great and you need to speak clearly while your show is getting to know you... so far so good with the new SHOW... as I use it we will see how it performs. I bought a second for my father for Xmas so we have to wait to test the calling feature for show to show. But for show to cell phone it works great🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Still you have all the features of the echo dot but better!!! You can watch tv, see online content re: recipes WAHOOOOO all you foodies
So, if your contemplating this I definitely would say DO IT!!!!
Hopefully they’ll come down on price in the future however, best deal is right now, Black Friday deal... 120.00 off when You buy 2 echo shows!! Happy turkey day Amazon..","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The reason I have not given it 5-stars is because it does not work with Sonos as all advertising leads you to believe. Yes, you can control your Sonos speakers by voice command from the ES, but the ES speaker is not recognized by Sonos, so it is not included in the speaker group. I purchased the ES to replace a Sonos speaker in a room, but now do not have the option to play it in a group - very disappointing!","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_77?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=77&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I noticed within 5 minutes, the Echo would close the browser entirely and go back to the home screen. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I never owned an electronic device that pissed me off so much. I'm ready to make my own Youtube video (that you would have to watch on any other device except the Echo Show) of me shooting this piece of garbage and FINALLY getting some enjoyment out of it.

Update (12/17/18): So I've had my Show for 2 months and I have to say that nothing really changed. It still remains an expensive disappointment. There has been an issue since the beginning where after watching so many videos on Prime Video, the show will no longer play videos until the device is restarted. My volume down and mute buttons are going to wear out from having restarted it so much. I have to do this about every 2 days. I know it needs to be restarted because when trying to play a video of any kind from any source, the Show will perform really slow and seem to load for a minute or two when selecting a video, then just back out and not play anything. This is kind of ridiculous. At the time of writing this, there is still no Netflix either. I see the Shows are sold out until after Christmas. I hope people aren't buying these as gifts or they're going to have some pretty disappointed spouse's/relatives.

I previously wrote a review with more stars, but the more I use the Echo Show, The more i'm starting to dislike it. Watching the movies that you own on Prime Video is a nightmare. Once you get a movie or show playing, it works fine. But the voice commands to get certain movies to play is a nightmare. Name a certain movie and she will say it back wrong, or say she couldn't find it. Try saying play whatever from my library, and she thinks it's a skill. It's super frustrating. Have Alexa turn lights off during a movie and the movie pauses for about a minute so it can show you a toggle button for you lights. Pause a movie? it'll stay paused for about a minute, then go to the home screen, to which there is no ""resume"" or ""continue movie"" command. You have to tell her to play whatever show or movie again. I bought this to replace an old Samsung tablet that I had on my desk to watch Youtube or Netflix while doing other things. I miss those days to be completely honest. I should have stuck with the regular screenless Echo that I had.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love being able to listen to music or watch videos, check the weather or ask Alexa anything and everything. I just turned 50 and I love my 80's hairband groups. I can just say.  ""Alexa play 80's rock music or one hit wonders"" and in a blink of an eye there it is and the screen shows the lyrics. If I don't like the choice I then say ""Alexa stop, next"" things like that and the songs change. I can also make calls while busy walking around. I can watch recipe videos to show each step. I can connect my pictures to see them on the screen.
I forgot to mention the sound quality is amazing and you can change the sounds to your own preferences.
I'm really new to this device and still learning but it can do SO much. I want to get a door bell that connects to this device and I can say ""Alexa show me the front door"" I then can see the front of the house.  Or when someone rings the bell it shows me who it is, some even have two way  microphones. You can buy special plug adapters to plug household items in and then you can control using ""Alexa"" to operate it, like TV's, lights, routers to control your kids time allowed on the internet. I know there are many more things it can do but I'm still learning. I didn't think I'd like or want anything like this in my home, boy was I wrong. I would recommend this product to everybody especially to us not so young individuals that think this product was stupid in the first place. I'll admit I was wrong.....LOL","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I def like the new one better as the screen size is awesome. It does sound better as well.

They had a Dot before, so they weren't totally new to the devices. I had showed them how to call me on the Dot, and they used it to call other family members too.

Once we got the Shows in both homes, it wasn't long before they were dropping in on me on a regular basis. I thought, at first, that it might be intrusive but there is a CLEAR tone that someone is dropping in and you have about 15-30 seconds before the view comes in to focus.

I love it. They just dropped in to find out when we would be traveling to see them. My mom told me about the cookies she made and I could see my dad eating them LOL. I like to be able to drop in on them to see how they are. When I'm away from home, I like to drop in on my own house to see what's going on and make sure it's all OKAY there.

It might take a bit to get your elderly parents set up on the Show but it's totally worth it. You can restrict access to certain times or completely. It's done by contact, not device. You can also set it up to go to your cell phone, I believe, with the Alexa app.

So, my update is not just about the device itself (but the newest Show is AWESOME ... I didn't know if it was worth upgrading but it IS) but also about it's functionality with faraway loved ones :)

The sound is AMAZING! A huge step up from the previous Show. I love the bigger screen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It does everything that the page says.  What the page doesn't say is that the ES doesn't run a web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).  You can't run common programs like Thunderbird or Gmail email programs.  It doesn't stream from Netflix.
What this really reminds me of is a smartphone in a larger box plus wireless bluetooth speakers.  If you want to control everything in your house with Zigbee devices do Skype-like video phone calls it will do that.  It has many links to content providers, many of which will charge you extra for their service.
If this is what you want, the ES will probably satisfy you.  If you want more as mentioned above, you need a laptop or all-in-one computer, which, granted, is quite a bit more expensive.
Not recommended except for its specific functions.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I now have gen 2 and I love it! I haven't had a chance to try video calls yet, but I've used lots of other stuff, including the basic Alexa stuff like shopping list, reminders and alarms, playing music, playing audio books and even music videos and Hulu! So far, I love it! I'm really glad I opted for the adjustable stand (at an additional cost). The only thing I wish I had so far is a physical volume up/down button. Sometimes you just want to tap the volume up or down quickly, but I don't think it has that. Otherwise, I super love it and I plan to get one for my Mom, too!

The Echo Show 2nd generation is Amazon’s latest entry in the major “land grab” to fully automate your home.  Being much more useful and refined than the Echo Show 1st edition, this device demonstrates that Amazon are good listeners; they discovered what users disliked about the first Echo Show and removed/reworked those functions and they discovered what users liked and improved those.
First, if you are new to the Echo Show line, let me describe some aspects of the device this way you know what you are getting.

Display:  This new Echo Show features a larger touch screen (10.1” vs 7” on the Echo Show 1st Generation); the additional screen real estate comes in really handy for watching movies or following recipe videos.  In addition, the resolution on the 2nd generation Echo Show has been bumped up to a more pleasing high definition (1280x720 resolution) from a non-hd (1024x600 resolution).  The result is a very nice looking screen featuring crisp, colorful pictures and videos.

Sound:  One of the reasons you would buy this device is to acquire a really smart speaker.  The sound on this Echo Show is very nice; the engineers kept the original two speaker design, but upgraded and, for better sound disbursement, moved the speakers from the front to the sides.  To help fill out the sound, they added a welcome addition, a “passive bass radiator.”  Which, according to Wikipedia, is an unpowered speaker where the “Internal air pressure produced by movements of the active driver cone moves the passive radiator cone.” Or, put another way, the air moved by the two inch speakers drives the bass speaker.  The result is a very enjoyable, full sound.  How does the sound coming from this Echo Show compare to the sound coming from similar Bose or Sonos Bluetooth speakers?  I do not have any experience with Sonos since I do not own one, but I have a Bose Sounddock and the Bose is clearly better.  However, this Bose speaker is not a smart display; I can give up a little sound quality to get all this device’s other cool functionality.  Anyway, the sound that is produced by this Echo Show is respectable and powerful enough to fill a medium sized room.

If you purchase this Echo Show and are disappointed in the sound, you always have the option to purchase a dedicated, high end Bluetooth speaker and pair (connect) it to your Echo Show.  The result would be the best of both worlds; audiophile sound with the functionality of a smart display.
Physical design:  The new Echo Show takes on a somewhat different form than the original Echo.  Instead of being all plastic, it is covered in a pleasant and decorative tweed looking fabric.  You get a choice of two colors, charcoal (dark gray) or sandstone (off white).  On top of the newly redesigned show are the physical volume buttons, a mute button to mute the volume and turn off the camera and four microphones.  On the front, near top of the screen bezel are four additional microphones.  These eight mics do a nice job of picking up your inquiries to Alexa to perform all of her different functions.  Additionally, one nice touch that will fly under the radar is the mini-usb port on the back.  This will enable you, via a usb to Ethernet adapter, to connect your Echo Show to your wired Ethernet connection.  Why is that important?  For various reasons, people do not have solid, reliable wireless coverage in their home or they might not even have a wireless connection at all.  This will help in those situations.

Software:  The area most in need of improvement is Echo Show’s software.  Owing to the contentious relationship between Google and Amazon, there is no way to easily access YouTube on the Echo Show Second Generation.  You can do it, but it takes effort.  The Echo Show has two browsers built in; Silk and Firefox.  So, you will need to ask Alexa to open Firefox (or Silk).  After your browser opens, you have to navigate to YouTube.  After you get into YouTube, you will need to perform a search via the onscreen keyboard.  Only after that, you will see your search results and can open your video.  Wouldn’t it be much easier to say “Alexa, show me YouTube videos with funny cats” and have those search results displayed on the screen?  However, if you want to watch YouTube videos, there is the capability to do so.
That brings me to another point.  You have a nice new device with a screen, but do not confuse it for a fully functioning computer.  Because there are no installed programs (or apps) like on your laptop or mobile phone, functionality is more limited.  For example, if you start going to different web pages via one of the browsers, it does not take long before you find pages displaying oddly—videos not playing and login boxes not working; it is all because the browsers are not the full-fledged browsers that you are used to accessing on your computer.  So, just keep in mind that even though this device looks like one, it is not a computer.  It excels at doing certain things like keeping your shopping list, keeping a daily planner, displaying cooking videos, accessing Amazon Prime movies, answering some basic questions and most importantly, controlling your smart home devices; it is worth owning this Echo Show just to perform these functions.

Zigbee Home Hub:  Huh?  You will see some information about the Echo Show being a Zigbee Home Hub and everyone touts it as something really important, but never really explain what is going on.  Let’s take a minute here to do that.  It turns out that the networking that you are using now, WiFi (802.11x), Bluetooth, and wired Ethernet are not good for all of the home networking devices that you own or will own in the near future.  That is where Zigbee comes in.  Zigbee uses a different networking standard (802.15.4) in order to connect all of the home automation devices that you own, think thermostats, light bulbs, plugs, security cameras and the like.  Now, with all of these different devices sending signals zooming around your house, you need something to pull them all together and control all the different aspects of them—are you on, are you off, turn the temperature up, turn it down, show me the backyard camera; in order to get all these to work, you need a hub.  That is where the second generation Echo Show comes in.  It is a Zigbee hub which will use this new 802.15.4 network to easily setup and control all of your Zigbee compatible devices.  Even though it does not sound like much, being a Zigbee hub is kind of a big deal.
To summarize, here are the pros and cons of the Echo Show Second Generation:

Pros:
-Sharp HD touch screen
-Nice sound, much better than any other Amazon Echo device
-Nice integration with Amazon Prime (videos, photos, music)
-Setup is very easy
-Stylish look; more modern and elegant than the first generation Echo Show
-Ability to connect to wired Ethernet
-Zigbee home hub

Cons:
-It is not a computer which you will discover if you regularly use either of the show’s built in browsers
-Poor integration with video other than Amazon Prime video (think YouTube, Sling TV, etc.)
-Lack of options to setup the home screen
-A ton of skills, but many are useless
-Supporting Z-Wave (alternate protocol to Zigbee) would have been nice","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Amazon - after touting this exact feature ("" You can listen to all your music!"") - then abruptly hobbled Amazon Music so you can no longer use it to play your own uploaded music, even if you bought it legally from Amazon in the first place (as I did). No explanation, just dropped it.

If you want to play exactly what Amazon tell you you can listen to, then this might work. And if you want an easier way to spend more money on Amazon, then go ahead. But they've hobbled Amazon Music and who knows what else they may just decide to drop from the Echo if it doesn't match their business objectives in the future.

Customer centric company? Alexa tells me different.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have a Fire Tablet which I use for movies and music and when I pair with my soundbar it is perfect.  Whenever I pair the Echo Show with the soundbar it continues to cut out frequently.  I had the same problem with my first gen Echo Show but not this bad.  I had to go back to using my regular Echo with the soundbar to get a good sound again. Whatever technology they installed in the Fire tablet and the Echo I wish they would pass on the Echo Shows because it just does not work.  My whole house runs on Alexa including thermostat, sprinklers, lights, etc. so I love the overall product - just not the Bluetooth so I can not fully recommend you buy it unless Bluetooth is not important, then it is superior in every other way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I’ve wanted to get one for over a year, the clunky look of gen 1 stopped me from buying it at the time, and I had 2 of the tallest 2nd gen Alexa speakers already. I didn’t think I could get a better sound than I already had.
I have my show on one side of the kitchen and my speaker on the other side and the sound in my kitchen is AMMMMMAAAAAAZZZIIIINNNNGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!  It’s juat a tic or two below the sound of a Bose stereo at a wayyy more reasonable price!
I have a lot to learn about all the things the echo  and the echo show can do, but I’m going to have a great time learning about it. Music is at the top of my reasons for having them. Without music this world would be a very dreary type of hell. I have music playing almost constantly 👍😁
Right now I have a screensaver of a crackling fire going. White noise can be very relaxing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I bought 3 so my kids and parents have them and we can video with granddaughter.

It is easy to use for things like turning on movies, music, video conferencing, viewing security cameras, and video conferencing.

HOWEVER, I cannot even fathom the reasoning behind not having even a short term battery. It comes with a six foot cord which won't even get you out of the room you're in.  My plan was to be able to keep it in my office and take to kitchen when needed.  I cannot do that without unplugging, replugging and waiting for it to set up.  The only reason I can come up with for no battery is Amazon doesn't want you to be able to take it room to room but wants you to purchase additional shows for each room you would need it in.  I find that frustrating...and a little infuriating. I am currently looking into whether a longer power cord can be purchased and will update when I find out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This one is very closed to perfect, but I'm ignoring youtube in this review since that have nothing to do with the actual product itself. It would be great if the home screen can rotate some photo/image of the day like the Google Home Hub can, it actually nicer to look at and not repetitive since it cycle differently every day. The Echo show just have some simple repeated artworks and cycle trending news, it gets old very quick. Unless you create your own album to let it cycle. Controlling lights is a bit unorganized when you have a large amount of smart lights in the house. The Google Home Hub have much better organization when it comes to linked smart home products. Though the 10.1"" screen amazing, really great for kitchen use. Sound is MUCH better than other smart display, bass and sound are just really good for what it is. Amazon could really use some features from the Google home hub to improve the Echo, it's REALLY close to being the best in the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The speakers sound great although 95% of the time use our surround sound speakers. This leads me to my top two complaints!
1. If you're selling an upgraded item, the new and improved, make sure it can do all the previous electric did + more. Especially when customers pre-order. The new Alexa show does not connect to your surround sound speakers properly. It sounds like headphones that are not plugged in all the way.
2. SUCKS to wait all year for the new product, pre-order it, pick it up and it cannot do one of the coolest features the old one did and your family uses A LOT!
So now the new Alexa show is sitting on my counter waiting for an update that hopefully will fix the issue.

I had been wanting a display device for use in the kitchen where I could refer to recipes while I am preparing a new dish and was also interested in purchasing an Alexa-enabled video doorbell so I could check to see who was at the door whenever I hear the dogs start barking while I am working on my computer in my home office.  I don't yet have the video doorbell but I did ask the new Show to display recipes for corn beef and cabbage, one of my husband's favorite dishes, and the images were sharp and the colors brilliant.  I also enabled an ambient sound skill and enjoyed both hearing the mountain river and seeing a relaxing HD video of the stream.

When I talk to Alexa on the Show and ask her to play a TV show or movie from Amazon Prime, she doesn't play it on the Show half the time.  No, she apparently plays it on my Fire TV stick.  Without me asking.  And then I can't get her to stop it.  I have to unplug the Fire TV.  And then if I leave it unplugged she will play the show on the Show.  You hae got to be kidding, right?  Also, you can't pause Hulu shows.  When you try to resume, nothing happens and you have to wait for her to reload the show all over again.  The more I use this device, the more it frustrates me.
Update:
With some help from Amazon, I was able to find the Firefox browser to pull up recipes on my own (I had been trying to find a Silk browser.  Because Amazon).  So much happier with usability as a kitchen companion.  But still difficult to figure out how to get other things done (Alexa couldn't find purchased music in my library).  Will keep rating at 3 for now.
---------------------------------------------
I bought this on impulse at an Amazon pop-up.  Admittedly, I'd had a couple of margaritas beforehand, but I distinctly remember the associate showing us how you could bring up a browser, and I had images of using this to bring up recipes to help me cook.  Well, apparently you can enable skills which allow you to find recipes, but you can't use recipes you've already found.  So it's a bust.

I already had an Echo in the kitchen for music and news, so the video aspect doesn't help there.  I will try to watch a show on Hulu to keep me company while I cook (something that doesn't need a recipe) and maybe that will be useful.

I do like that it shows the upcoming events from my calendar, but it's a really expensive reminder device...","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_62?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=62&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's size and clarity of screen, audio and ease of setup. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has limited compatibility with my Nest Doorbell and Arlo security systems. While I can view the cameras on these devices I cannot do vocal communication nor will the Echo show create an audio alert when my doorbell is rung. It does not work at all with my Schlage electronic door locks.  Least not that I can figure out.

Saying 'Alexa' is also easier and more reliable than 'OK Google' or 'Hey Google'.

As for screen quality on this unit, very nice.  And the audio quality is very good.  I love the fact that you can get some thumping bass from this product too.  It's audio quality is sufficient to fill an entire room.  All the features that Amazon advertises for this product work pretty well, to really well.  It's not often that this happens.....

The home automation aspects of this Smart Display are very good, to great.  It relies heavily on having the Alexa App on your smartphone, but I don't see this as a big drawback.  And the Mic array is particularly adept at hearing you correctly the first time....

I'm not going to do a deep dive on all the features....as Amazon's content on the site does a good job of this.  For the asking price, I think it's one of the best Smart Displays released so far this year.  And because I'm Prime, I get tons of content right off the bat, i.e. music, movies, apps, shopping, order updates 'Alexa', where's my stuff, etc.

Google Home Hub sits in the bedroom.....Echo Show Gen 2 sits in the kitchen, where we spend 70% of our time.  Provided Amazon continues to push updates to this unit for some time to come, I think this experience will only get better and better!  Can't wait.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Almost all of our content comes from Amazon and I would expect it to work easily. Trying to get a movie to play can sometimes take forever.
""Alexa, play Rouge One""
""Sorry, I cannot find any services that can play Rouge One, A Star Wars Story. Try managing you video apps on the Alexa app""

Constantly it will understand what you say but fail to get any content, whether movies or audio playlists. For a device that had a touchscreen it suggests you use the Alexa app on your phone almost half the time.

The home screen is annoying and there are a few volume issues where you might get really surprised when Alexa speaks with much greater volume than the content playing.

Bought two so we could let the kids video call my in-laws. Needing a smartphone besides mine too set that up was frustrating.

This makes the first ""family"" device that only makes sense to have on the kitchen counter. Profiles and multiple users are terrible and it can only learn one voice per user account.

Everything works great 20-30% of the time and it feels like a great purchase, but it's often frustrating.

Other issues.","December 31, 2018","Perhaps you would like to watch videos on this device. Amazon Prime, YouTube, Hulu?
After a few minutes the screen times out and returns to the home screen.
The device cannot resume where you left off. You must go through the entire video location procedure and start over.
Quite disappointing. No way to change time out.
Also times out for Amazon Prime Music screen and returns to home screen. If you touch the screen, it will return to the music screen, but will time out again.
As others have pointed out, the home screen always has ""Alexa try..."" or ""Alexa show me the best selling...( fill in random Amazon product here). No way to shut this off.
Over all it is merely ok. Lots and lots of room for improvement.
Mostly underdeveloped technological possibilities and therefore
annoying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(updated with new information)","November 6, 2018","To me the software is so buggy seems like it was pushed out before testing was finished. Specifically:
1. Do not disturb doesn't work. At first it refused to set the time. Then it would immediately go into that mode even outside the specified time period. The issue was discussed in various forums and couldn't find a solution yet.
2. Photo slideshow doesn't work either. Uploaded my photos to prime photos and specified fast (2 seconds) for slideshow. The picture doesn't change for minutes! After waiting a while for it to finally changed a couple times, it stuck and stopped!

How can functionality so basic failed so miserably?

update 11/7/2018
----------------------
decided to revise my rating from 2 to 4 stars based on the following:
1. received phone calls and email from Amazon customer service after just a few hours leaving the comment with offer to help. surprised by the speed and appreciate the sincere effort.
2. after letting the device sat overnight, the 'do not disturb' feature started to work and the slideshow is behaving better (still slow, but at least work consistently).

i suspected the device came with old software and were updated constantly in the background. so you might want to let it sit for a while before exploring the features seriously.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

She complained that she has to work visually...  so she didn't like entering a shopping list on my amazon Tap.

Problem solved.  She just says alexa. Add apples to the shopping list.  Boom.  Then later.. she can say alexa show me the shopping list.  Boom.  Visual.  AND I can see it on my phone on the way home and I can pick stuff up.

The sound quality is much better than the Echo Spots we have. Also being able to visually see multiple timers is very handy. Honestly I am extremely disappointed that I can not read my kindle cookbooks on the Echo Show. Sure you can have it read to you in Alexa's robotic voice but that isn't practical. I think not being able to access the kindle books is a huge flaw! If they would allow full access to your Kindle library that would make this product much more useful. Also would be handy to have icons for skills on a home screen because lets be honest some skills require very specific wording that doesn't roll of the tongue naturally. Overall it isn't terrible but it is missing some key features.

A bit annoyed that I can’t tell Alexa to pull up a YouTube video. Seems Alexa answered question when I first plugged in now seems she doesn’t know anything. Have asked her things I asked Her the first day and now says she doesn’t know. I think amazon screwed themself when they blocked google from using their things now we suffer more. I would have recommended but now I don’t, to many cons this was just a few cons I’ve listed and not enough pros. The pros good video chat, good to pull recipes up will keep it on a good amount of time. Like how you can put her to sleep so tv doesn’t command her. Like the few workouts they have, wish they would add more apps though. The Smart device hookup is good and does have a lot to offer.

The 1st gen software was upgraded to the same as the 2nd gen, so if you have the 1st, you won't need to upgrade to the 2nd to use the new software features unless.. you want the full screen and a much better sound experience.

The 1st gen device configuration was very poor with its boxy appearance and annoyingly prominent speaker location.  The full screen presentation of the 2nd gen combined with the speaker moved to the rear is a winner and in my opinion, that alone is worth the upgrade but then I just like new electronics.  The 2nd gen device looks better on the counter, it's sharp and easier to see text from across the kitchen because the screen is larger. The software update also centered the announcements on the screen which adds to the new look and makes it easier to read on the larger screen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Con - the recipes don't stay on the screen so you can't keep referring to them and scroll up/down, it's annoying. The screen goes back to music. It's also hard to pull up your recipes, you have to give Alexa a series of specific commands.

1. The new screen is a significant improvement.
2. The already excellent voice recognition range appears to be improved due to front facing microphones.  More experience is required here.
3. Better low end extension to the audio.
And the lowlights:
1. The fabric is nice right now but will degrade and makes it difficult to clean the device.
2. The display is edge lit and the backlight is very visible and annoying.
3. Alexa (and all content) sounds like she's living in a box because the speakers aren't front facing.

It looks like they tried to upgrade everything but in the design room the form team won out over the function team.

The device sounds great, is easy to set up, and is dead simple for home automation purposes.  However, the bottom of the screen is interrupted by a constant advertisement from Amazon to try various Echo skills. This cannot be shut off.  It's always there ruining the screen.  It nearly caused me to dump the Echo ecosystem entirely and switch to Google (I still may...).

If the constant advertisement doesn't bother you,  consider this a 4/4.5 star review.

I've purchased 4 units and have trouble connecting all of them so we can video call. The newest of them calls only one way, when I call it tells me that the party I called didn't pick up when they are actually waiting by the show for a call.

Hope this gets better, after buying four of them , kinda of expensive, it seems I will be using the phone. Has not been a good experience. My next move will be calling Amazon help.

While the spot is PERFECT for a desk, or a nightstand, the Echo Show is great for entertainment (however my Echo Show is right next to my bed ass well...lol). I LOVE this. Bright screen, lots of color, and easy to use. You can  completely turn off the screen by voice if it's next to your bed, or set it to dim really really low. On the lowest auto brightness setting this gets dark enough for me to sleep without disturbing me.

The sound is the best of any device I have so far. It also comes with Silk and Firefox for browsing, enabling you to do just about everything from it!

I purchased this one because the first one I bought stopped responding after 5 hrs.  This one did the same thing.  So, then I wanted to try and resolve the issue.  The support team didn’t have any answers since I had called them the first time.  So, I looked online for help.  One person said to turn on the Do Not Disturb under settings and this didn’t work.  Another person said to check the network.  So, the echo show was on an extended network (we have a repeater to get a better signal).  I took it off the extended network and put it on the main network and it works fine.  So, I still had the first one and did the same for that one and now it works fine.  Three days in and they are both responding every time.  Awesome!

Also, I had purchased a google home hub and it doesn’t work well with an iPhone.  It’s more difficult to set up and sync then Alexa.  I do like the fact that the google home hun read recipes step by step and pauses until you’re ready to continue.

Limitations abound.","January 4, 2019","Just terrible. The Echo Show is so limited. Could be great in a few years but I’m not willing to wait because it’s TERRIBLE RIGHT NOW. Let’s start with what it CANNOT do.
Can’t play: YouTube or Netflix.
Doesn’t search: you can ask it questions but it won’t know 90% of them AND it won’t search it on bing. So the ad that Amazon shows saying “Alexa show me a recipe” is FALSE. You can’t manually type in searches either.

Partial capabilities: Searching, some apps let you search. Let’s start with Hulu. You can bring up Hulu but won’t have the option from the home screen to search on Hulu. You’ll have to find the right verbal request that’ll allow you to drag the endless screen for what you want. Example: I wanted to watch the current season of South Park.
Me: “Alexa play South Park season 22 episode 1.”
Alexa: “here is South Park season 1 episode 1.”
This happened every time! I had to have it bring up the South Park page then scroll to the episode I wanted. 22 seasons of scrolling took so long!
Let’s talk about the touch screen! THE NON RESPONSIVE TOUCH SCREEN! I practically had to punch the thing to get it to react to my haptics. Am I supposed to double PUSH to get a video to play? Or pause? Don’t even try to drag the progress bar to rewind advance an episode or song, just accept your fate and play from where you’re at or start over.
I can complain about so many more first world problems here, but it’s not worth my time or yours. Pass on this and get a tablet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- The microphones are not as receptable as regular echo, probably due to 4 microphones on front. We placed it in a corner, and doesn't properly recognize from any side.

- Bug: There is an issue when we configured the echo show homepage to rotate Amazon photos album. Every two days, it  gets stuck at a photo, only way to make it work again is to restart, which is a pain point.

- Request: Echo devices need to support casting from mobile apps for more apps as its too much a pain-point to connect to bluetooth to play everytime.

Sound is very good and overall a great product. I had been using an echo which I liked but was going to purchase an echo plus but decided to get a Show, Spot, and fire tab 8 with Alexa. My biggest complaint is you truly cant get the display to show what you want. With some effort you can get close but ultimately you get messages that say Try""Alexa …. Playing movies and such is also not convenient. I have several fire sticks and they work great and way easier then the Show. Another issue is if you start adding hi Res cameras you better have a very good internet connection. I run dual band DSL and upload speed seems to get in the way with a few devices running. With a few software changes it could be a great product, the hardware is overall very good. My spot and show went back. I kept the tab but still fighting with show mode when I put it on the wireless dock (show dock). I may end up abandoning the dock and simply use it without show mode.  Going back to echo, a very nice product","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have had the Original Echo with Alexa for 5 years. I cannot be without Alexa!! We have always used as a timer, shopping list, Pandora, prime music, sleep sounds, and various other skills. I like the Show, but I had higher expectations. We are going to use it with the Ring Doorbell system and to video call relatives, but so far I have used it for recipes while cooking and prime video. So my problem is while using a recipe, I also wanted to set a timer. Once it goes to the timer, you can't tell her to resume the recipe, you have to ask her to find the recipe again and start over. I was also watching/listening to a movie and had the same issue. She won't just go back to where it left off. I had to ask for the movie again from scratch. But it did pick up where it left off once I got it back up. ""Third world problems""! Overall, I'm glad I got it and cannot wait to find out what else it can do and see how it gets smarter over time, like the Echo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Heres my review and criticisms of this device. Im confused and conflicted about this device. I feel like Amazon knows they need to improve on the software. Pros : Sounds amazing - 11/10. Like seriously, the bass on this thing is wow. It's really clear.

Now onto the cons.. On my phone, I can touch anywhere, and get a response. There needs to be a back button, there needs to be swipe functionality, like from the bottom up on an iPhone.  Im touching parts of the UI on the Show expecting it to do something, and Im frustrated that I can/cant click on certain things that are or arent obvious. There needs to be a Device list similiar to how I control my devices via my Android on my phone.

I can say Alexa (show) turn on Philips Hue. I get the Device, it pops up. I even get a brightness bar. But I cant view any of these devices whatsoever in the 30 Internet-of-thing type devices I have connected to the Alexa ecosystem. What. Why? I dont have friends. I dont use this for making calls or video calls. Thats what phones are for. This product should really be relagated or somehow updated via software to include alot of the features lacking.

The homescreen is extremely limited. There needs to be way more access to font sizes, font types, what shows up on the home screen. I mean come on, Google killed it. There needs to be options for screen ""timeout"". Just take a page from Android 9.0 or whatever.

If Amazon takes into account these comments seriously - and I think they do, especially with the always learning doomsday robot named Alexa, she'll probably write code just based on reading this comment.

Edit (1 hour later) - Seems Amazon does take these comments seriously. I got a phone call - asking for feedback. Not even an hour after posting this review. I further explained my situation. Interesting. Gave them more feedback on the ecosystem. I think it really comes down to Software. The hardware is great. Few other things mentioned. Im still unsure whether I will be keeping the device. It is cool to note that they do (for obvious reasons, they read the comments) just wasn't expecting a call or anyone to care or read. As busy as they are, and to receive a followup call. Hope my voice recorded feedback helps, Mr. Bezos.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Big issues:
Ring integration: The Ring integration sucks. When motion is detected or a doorbell press happens, you should have the option to have the Show automatically display the Ring camera that's reporting in.

Web video: I had aims to use the device to watch Youtube videos and read about the workarounds that exist for the device inexplicably not having a Youtube app (due to some Amazon tiff with Google). I thought I could get around this by using the integrated browsers, but this really doesn't work well. The browsers seem to expunge cookies every time you switch to the home screen, so you get logged out. Youtube, Youtube TV and DirecTV online viewing are basically non-starters. Who the heck uses Hulu?

Audio mic: Our old first gen Alexa (not the show version) had no issues understanding us when being asked to do something. This gen 2 Alexa Show has a much harder time picking up requests and many times we have to repeat the requests multiple times before it figures it out.

Lack of recipe content: There are tons of simple recipes that I ask for that just aren't found. This highly touted functionally of this device pretty much stinks.

On the plus side, the sound quality is pretty good. The screen looks fine and is bright enough.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was very excited that he can play his music by voice command since he is not technology savvy. The hope was that the voice command will allow him to listen to music when he wants. Unfortunately Alexa pays two to three songs and stops. He has become so frustrated with the process of constantly asking to play songs that can't be found, and going to Youtube and getting bumped off so frequently that in a few days he said he does not want to use it anymore because it is too stressful.
My internet search shows this is an inherent problem with the system and many have sited this short coming with Alexa. I think the company is obligated to address this issue and should assist persons who bought this faulty system.

We started with a Echo Spot in our kitchen with the idea that some music or an audio book might be nice to help pass the time while stuck in the kitchen. Once we got used to the Spot the Show started to sound like more of an good idea.

I've had the Show for a month now and am really pleased with it. The sound is great and the video is nice to have for YouTube or other videos. It even connects to my Ring doorbell although I haven't used this feature much yet.

A couple of nitpicks...
The shape of it does not allow for the Echo Show to be easily mounted to a wall or under cabinet. Important for those of use with limited counter space.
YouTube has to be set to 'desktop' in order to watch it without the screen timing out. This was frustrating to have to work out.
The touchscreen could be easier to use. At least for my old and inflexible fingers. I might purchase a pen for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Good size screen
- Great for recipes
- News articles are an okay bonus

Cons
- You can't search the internet
- video quality for video chats are not good
- you can only watch tv on PRIME and all the good shows COST ADDITIONAL MONEY - this is the big reason I am only giving this a 2 star review and consider that lucky
-Netflix and Hulu are NOT compatible
- You cannot search the internet

When using normal volume speech, but with the Echo volume set fairly low, Alexa now answers at a suitably low volume. And today, I was able to activate the new Whispermode, which works great! You whisper to Alexa, she whispers back to you.

 I'm raising my rating to 4.5 stars. If Amazon would ever remove the annoying “Try this” messages ruining my home screen photo (and music screens as well), I would probably rate this as 5 stars. (This is unfortunately unlikely to happen, as Echo Show users have been complaining about this for a year and a half, but it hasn't changed.)

I upgraded from the first generation Echo Show. I’ll get my one real complaint out of the way first. On the second generation Show, you can lower the volume for music and videos, but not for the Alexa voice. Even with the volume set very low, so I can listen to music without disturbing anyone, if I need to interact with Alexa, her response will be very loud. This didn't happen with the first generation Echo. On that one, if I turned down the volume, everything was turned down, including Alexa. I did send feedback to Amazon about this, and I see someone else here commented on the problem. I'm eagerly awaiting the new whispermode, which isn't on my device yet, but really, I just want the voice volume to work the same way it did on the first generation.

I do really like the bigger screen size, which is a pleasure to watch. I'm also enjoying using the Silk browser to access YouTube. (You get to it by saying “Alexa, open Silk.” ) You can't use voice to search for YouTube videos, but if you're willing to sign into a YouTube account, you can access your saved video lists and get to the videos quickly that way. I also used the browser to access my local PBS TV station and watched some on demand video on that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

By way of example, I subscribe to a couple of sports teams calendars linked to my apple calendar.  These show up on my apple calendar.  These subscriptions also show up on the Alexa app (so it does know they are there), and are checked to be included on the device...yet they are not. Called about it was told it was being sent up (as they also told me with a FireTv issue) and that I would hear back in 2-4 days.  As with the still unresolved FireTV issue I never hear back from anyone and so now I have two unresolved issues.

Normally I would not care but I do a lot of umpiring and all of my assignments come through Arbiter (probably has no meaning to most reading).  But I am subscribed to an Arbiter calendar that automatically puts these events on our family apple calendar.  I purchased this so the family could see when I had games.  But again, this does not work--despite the calendar being checked in Alexa to be included on the device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Video chatting is easy and simple to apple or android devices. Philips hue smart bulb connected easily with “Alexa, discover devices”. The consistent carousel of content, reminders, upcoming events and news keeps me checking the screen throughout the day.

It does what it's claimed to do. I bought it as an upgrade to the Aamazon Dot I got a year ago. The crystal clear sceen is excellent - very sharp colors for any picture or video you might play. I'm not that into music, although I do you it occasionally for that. I mostly enjoy watching YouTube Videos on it.

In regards to YouTube access, you just ask Alexa ""Open Silk"" to open its browser, and use the touch screen to open YouTube. I found it easy to use. It's cumbersome typing in the specific video you want, so it's best to touch the microphone icon and simply speak the name of the video. Once videos appear, you can use the screen to scroll to the one you want.

I only have a couple minor complaints: The screen is always on unless you tell Alexa ""Screen Off"". But if you happen to bump the screen with your hand or arm, it comes back on. There is no ""off"" button. You can use the Do Not Disturb feature to have the screen be off at specific times, but again, if you accidently touch the screen again, it comes on.

Secondly, the reviews rave about the sound quality. But I've found that the bass seems to be pretty strong, resulting in a sort of a muffled sound when Alexa responds to a question. You have to adjust the volume in those cases where the voice isn't super clear. The voice on the Echo Dot is clearer at times in comparison. At least that's my opinion. Others may disagree.

Overall, I really like this product. It's screen is big, but the unit isn't much bigger than the screeen so it doesn't take up a lot of space on a counter or table. I don't use the Echo Show every day, but I'm still glad I spent the money on it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The addition of the video was such a huge improvement over the original devices.  I had to try this new Show (2nd Gen) as my biggest concern with the original Show was that the screen was too small for kitchen/living room use.  I like to check my schedule, weather, recipes, watch videos, etc. while cooking and it was originally a tad small for that from across the room.  This new Show seems the perfect size for the kitchen.  My only issue is that the speakers have moved from the front on the 1st gen (facing where you would be standing in front of the device) to the back of the 2nd gen Show.  I have mine on the corner counter (8 inches from the wall) in the kitchen, and between being in the corner, and with cabinets above, it now sounds a bit like its muffled in a tunnel.  I know some people originally complained because the 1st gen Show looked like a micro old projector TV, but that didn't bother me.  In an effort to streamline and make the screen bigger, the speakers were moved to the rear.  Just something to keep in mind when deciding where to place this device (and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars).

We don't! The Alexa Communications Ap for calling contacts has to be installed on a smart phone.  Without it you can not make visual calls. They down load your phone contacts through Alex Communications for Echo Show.  We still have our two flipflops phone because it is only $50 a month for unlimited texting through Verizon designed for retirees on a fixed income.  I hope Amazon doesn't ignore the grandparent market who would enjoy the visual phone calls of their grandchildren as advertised on the commercial and develops a software ap, so Alex Communications can be compatible with Office ""People contacts.""  Presently I use a Verizon text application on my computer so I can type texts on a real keyboard - my laptop when texting.  Amazon Echo show team should talk to Verizon.

I use it to ask questions, activate Alexa compatible devices, play Spotify, etc. However, it also makes a great speaker phone since you can link a mobile phone number and have it make calls. Very useful since I work from home sometimes. It also has a browser (2 actually), so you can get to things like YouTube with a couple steps. It gets plenty loud if you want it to. Alexa is getting better at answering questions asked with natural language, but there are still times when I feel like I have to memorize a specific way to ask for certain functions.

This defect appeared in my 1st generation Show about six months after purchase. What happens is that a loud click or pop can be heard when the audio activates. Ask Alexa a question and you hear a pop before and immediately after the response. Play music or a podcast or any audio/video source, and within 5 minutes of starting, sometimes earlier, the pop/click appears randomly, though as the video clip shows it occurs on average about every 10 seconds while there is an audio source. You can avoid this distraction by using a bluetooth speaker, but my point of contention is that this is a defect that has not been addressed by the manufacturer. I purchased a 2nd generation Show before this issue cropped up with my 1st generation one so I can only hope that the defect has been addressed in the 2nd generation. If this issue were addressed I could easily give this product 5 stars since it has so many advantages over the various dots that I also own. I will not, however, be replacing them until I am convinced that this serious audio defect is addressed and corrected.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was fortunate enough to get into an early adoption queue.

It's amazing how embedded into my daily life these things have become.  I use them for so many things - from morning repeating reminders to get my son his ADD medicine to timers for cooking and my favorite, adding things to my shopping list.  I love being able to just ask for a song and have it play.

Weather forecasts, current temp outside, news synopsis...  It has become such an integral part of our household.

The Echo Show was a nice addition, I liked the screen, especially when it came to monitoring multiple timers, or being able to look at lists without having to use the app.  But it was a bit small for use across the room, so some things I didn't ask unless I was closer to it.

This new one removes that restriction.  Screen is huge, seeing the two side by side is just amazing.  It's bigger than I had expected just from reading the specs and measurements.  Screen is vibrant and crisp, text is clear and photos are well displayed.

My son loves that there are so many genres of jokes he can ask.

I love that the Echo is one of the central parts of my automated home.  Switches all over the house, lights, thermostat and video cameras - I love being able to just ask to see a camera and seeing it, or turning lights on and off, or changing the temperature of the house.  I was happy before the Echo devices to be able to do all that from the cell phone, but it's even more useful now that the Echo can control so many things.  Works well with IFTTT but I still prefer the skills where it can directly access something.

There just isn't a downside.  I'm passing my V1  Echo Show to my mother, who also received my V1 Echo when I upgraded to the newer little cylinder tower for the V2 Echo.  And I've given her my old V1 dot when I got the newer dot.  It's nice having them in a few places around the house.  The dot in my bedroom is my only alarm clock I use anymore, despite having a nice Philips glow light wakeup system...  It is just so much easier to say, ""Alexa, set alarm for 6 AM,"" than to hit the buttons on the alarm clock.  Especially when you're setting different times for different days.

And even for napping sometimes - just tell it what time to sound the alarm, and take a little nap without worrying about napping too long and screwing up your sleep schedule.

Worth every penny for my household, wouldn't be without one anymore...","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Let the user decide if we want hints displayed on the bottom of the screen. I don't. Give us a software option to turn hints off. Provide a simple on/off toggle button in the settings.

I would give this product a 5-star rating if this one major annoyance was remedied. The home screen should allow some customization by the end user.

It was easy, and in a matter of minutes I was up and running.

I began familiarizing myself with its nuances. It wasn't much of a learning curve, as I own the Spot, so...  I must say I was impressed with the screen resolution and size. Bright, easily readable from across the room. I love the color details when viewing Youtube videos, as it was faithfully reproduced.

Music was loud, and some good bass was present. It was easily navigable via the touch screen, or voice commands. And the browsers, Firefox and Silk, launch on command. Cool. Say, 'launch Youtube', and you're there. Sign in to you YT account, and play all videos in your History; or simply tap the address bar, and when the keyboard appears, type in what you want to see.  It isn't a seamless way to go about it, but at least it works.

All-in-all, the Show really delivers on Amazon's stated features and capabilities. I am happy with the Show, and if you aren't very picky, you may be too. Let's begin...

Should you consider purchasing the 2nd gen. Echo Show?  If you like your music sounding great; if you like watching videos on an immersive 10"" screen; if you want to browse the internet as you would on a large tablet; watch Vevo or Youtube--yes, you should consider the Echo Show over its competitors. The 2nd generation Echo Show is vastly improved over the 1st generation Echo Show, which looked boxy, and had only seven inches of real screen real estate. Sound on that one was, at best, acceptable. Nothing to dance about, though.

But on the newer incarnation the sound quality is quite good--no, damn good! You'll get powerful stereo sound. Bass punches solidly, so that you can actually feel it. Highs and mids takes care of rounding out the music quite well, and in stereo. Amazon improved the speaker system so, that you'll wonder how it could sound so good from a smallish footprint. But it does! And this thing can get quite loud. It filled our rather large bedroom without distortion, even nearly way up. Put it in a large living and your next party will be complete with D.J. Alexa on hand.

Getting around on the internet with either the Silk browser or Firefox was as easy as saying, ""Alexa, open..."", and you're taken to the browser where you key-in what site you wish to visit. Sure, the on-screen keyboard is a bit clunky, but you get used to it.

I've not tested the video-calling feature, or the drop-in feature, but from the rave reviews on Amazon about this, it's a winner. Skype will soon be coming to the Show.

I was impressed by the screen quality and accurate color reproduction, even from across the room. Most aren't going to want to sit through an entire two-hour movie, though, but you could if you wanted to. A greater majority relegate the Show to kitchen duty, where it shines. Still, any room (not the bathroom!) is a good place for the Show.

So, in my opinion, yes you should consider bringing home the Show instead of the competition's products, as Amazon got it right the second time around. And at $230, I'd say it is priced just right to go.

Well, I'll play with this gadget a few days more. In the meantime, The Echo Show must go on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

K","UPDATED:  Great upgrade to v1 but with caveats about how to set brightness settings for bedside use.","October 23, 2018","Edit Nov 2, 2018.
I've been working with Amazon support on my issues around how the device handles light level detection and how it behaves overnight when used as a bedside device.  My main issues were 1) the device did not sleep as expected (so it was distracting while sleeping) and 2) the ambient light sensing mode did not work properly (it made the device VERY dark).  I have some updates and feedback on Amazon's support process and where we stand.

First, Amazon support has been excellent.  They reached out to me directly to discuss the issues and have solicited my feedback and ""evidence"" (videos for example) to demonstrate the behavior.  They've had their engineering team involved... so it's obvious they are taking this seriously and want to fix the issues assuming they are valid and can be validated.  This is what I'd expect.  I'm very happy so far.

Related to sleep mode.  At night, by default, I've determined that if the ""Adaptive Brightness"" is turned on then the device will not sleep properly and will continue to cycle through the various screens prompting you for interactions.  The normal stuff.  If you turn ""Adaptive Brightness"" OFF then it does work.  This is counter intuitive but the good news is that this mode works and resolves the issue of the device working as a bedside device, I'm happy to say.

In relation to when the Adaptive Brightness mode is ON and the device becoming too dark I am still working on validating that with support.  They're serious about fixing the issue so I'm hopeful.

I've raised my review rating based on the above and my genuine positive experience with the Gen2 Show outside of those issues.  The audio is superb, the screen is great, and it's a great platform.  I am completely willing to recommend the device now assuming folks understand the dimming issues mentioned above and how to address them.  To summarize, currently:
1. For Bedside use disable ""Adaptive Brightness"" in the display settings.  This allows the device to go into sleep mode at night when next to you on a bedside table.
2.  When not used as a bedside device it's ok to use Adaptive Brightness but be aware that you may need to turn the brightness level up so that it doesn't go too dark.  IF you turn AB on and the screen goes to dark just raise the brightness level as I noted.

Original review:
So, I have 3 V1s and now 2 V2 Shows.  I like the devices, obviously, or I wouldn't have invested in them for use around the house.  The 10"" V2 is a great upgrade in most ways.  Bigger screen, much better sound, some new interface features (but Echo still needs a LOT of work in this area) but it also has a nearly game breaking flaw.

On all of my V1s the screen dimming worked awesome.  If it was night time and there was no activity in a room the screen would dim, intelligently, and the display would just show the clock.  The idea here obviously was to reduce distractions during sleep.  This made the Show a great device for the bedside.  Not any more (at least for now).

V2 of the show has a serious problem with dimming and ""sleep"" detection, as I would call it.  There are two problems compared to the previous model:
1.  The device does not properly detect light levels, or react to them, so that if the Ambient Light sensor is ""enabled"" it will dim to an almost unreadable state if the ambient light source is behind the unit.  Sometimes even if it's not.  I had to turn this feature off completely as I could not see the display on my devices about half the time!
2.  The biggest flaw is that the device NO LONGER detects that a room has no activity if used at bedside (and possibly elsewhere).  I spent a very restless night because the screen on my Show V2 would NOT go to ""sleep"" mode (where it completely dims and only the clock is shown) and it was SUPER annoying.  I have no idea how to fix this.  I cannot use the Ambient Light sensor because then I would not be able to see the device during the day much of the time.  I'm puzzled.

Note that I've confirmed that the V2 is using the same settings as the V1 so this should not be happening.  In general... it's a big problem and if it's not resolved I may be returning the device here before too long.  The bigger display and improved sound are not worth losing sleep at night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen is larger.  You  can use Firefox and play youtube.

The bad for me is my one young kitty goes nuts for sound, and the speakers in the back make her want to flip this over. Tv sounds are low, so adjusting the volume from music to tv is a slight pain.

I use mine to drop in on the cats while working. Most of the time they get busted doing naughty things.

Drop in and calling is very handy, when someone can't be with you, they can check on you.

I can truly say the Show 2nd generation is a worthy upgrade if you listen to music on it.
The audio is fantastic with lush deep low end and richer mid-range and highs.
We listen to a lot of music in our kitchen with ours and this one thing makes it so worthwhile to me.
The screen is noticeably larger and looks like it is higher resolution.
Watching movie trailers or shows is even better.
I can only imagine that one day there will be small TV sized Alexa Shows. I would love to replace the 27"" TV that is on the wall right behind the Alexa Show with a larger screen Show 3 or whatever is in the pipeline. I can have a Fire TV stick on it but that is different than the Show. It doesn't pop up tidbits of information nor wake to ""Alexa"". Perhaps a Fire TV Cube would work, but again it has a bit of a different feel than a Show. I think the Show is the perfect counter top or table device, so I guess what I'm asking is simply to have a Fire TV have a setting where it acts more like a Show. But then again my TV doesn't have motion sensors to know when you've walked into the room. Nor does it stay on all the time. - Maybe there is something to my wish after all.
Anyways, I am really impressed. If you already have a gen 1 Show then you may be fine to keep with it. I'm giving mine to my Mother-in-law so we can video chat with her. It will be more than enough for her needs. But if you listen to music a lot or really want a larger screen then the Show 2 delivers on those. 5 Amazing Stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We use it to listen to both Amazon Music and SiriusXM and it certainly doesn't disappoint even with the so-so quality of some of the Sirius channels.
We have several 'smart' plugs and switches in our home and this device makes it easy to control them all from one room using your voice or pulling up the list of devices on the screen and interacting with them that way.  It is really helpful for managing a large number of connected devices.
I recently activated the 'intercom' feature for use with our old Echo 1st gen.  I put the older Echo downstairs so that my spouse could communicate easily with me upstairs on the Echo Show if she wanted to (she just had a baby).  This feature seems to be working well.
We also often use it for recipes, our Echo Show is on the kitchen counter.  While the recipe displaying functions are great, the Alexa service is lacking in how it searches for recipes.  Many times if will hear you correctly, but present you with a list of recipes that are nowhere near to what you asked for.
We have also used this device to quickly look up a product that we might quickly need for the baby or for mommy and it seems to do well in that regard, presenting you with relevant items.
Aside from that, it is also great at the general Alexa-type stuff; weather, sports scores, etc.
One kind of odd thing I noticed is that after enabling the 'messaging' (intercom) feature, skills I was using that had the word 'text' in their intent requests wouldn't work; the Alexa service would recognize the word 'text' and hijack the intent, ignoring the context of the rest of the user's input and instead asking you who you would like to text message.  Not cool.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First, if you’re not VERY specific, you’ll probably get “hmmm, I don’t know that”. So then you’ll go through a dozen different ways of saying the same thing, before it will finally “get” it. It’s not intuitive at all. It should have come with a manual stating exactly how you have to say something in order to get it to work. Try adding multiple lights in the same room to a group so you can turn them all on or off at once. Do it perfectly the first time, or you’ll find yourself telling it a dozen times what you want, only to have it repeat the wrong thing back to you. Over. And over. And over.

So the Amazon Echo Show does show me the feed of my Ring doorbell, but my expectations were the Echo Show to display the feed if someone rang the doorbell. It's a bit cumbersome needing to ask ""Alexa"" to show the camera IF you know that someone is at the door.  Ideally, this functioned more like the Nest doorbell + Google home mini hub. It's kind of a head scratcher why this feature wasn't included as it's a pretty common use case people would expect to have.
My 2nd complaint is that it does not continuously cycle through my Amazon photos.  After a while, it just stays on one photo.  I've read that unplugging/plugging in the device would cycle through the photos again (or asking ""Alexa"" to play slideshow).
Knowing what I know now, I probably would have opted for a Nest doorbell to go with my Google home mini hub for my home video surveillance needs (although I would still be using the less expensive Echo devices since I prefer ""Alexa"" voice commands) and skipped purchasing this.

Make no mistake, this is not a high resolution TV for streaming your favorite Prime video channels, nor is it the perfect sounding speaker to stream Amazon music, but it does both of those things quite well.

There are not many skills that take advantage of the display on this echo device, but I like the simple clock that it is for most of my day.

The touch screen performs well and the microphone seems to work better than on my echo dots.

In terms of sound, it gets loud and it sounds pretty good, but it does a weird thing with bass. It's almost like there is a dedicated driver for bass, and that it's coupled with a vibration motor, because if you can feel it, it's deeper, right? I don't know what it is, but it's overemphasized to my ears, giving the impression that it's trying too hard to be a great speaker, instead of settling for just being a really good speaker.

The mute button is convenient, but I'd have liked to see a shutter for the camera as well. Ultimately, I'd have liked to use this echo device in the bedroom, but not with that camera on it. It shall remain in the 'public' parts of my home.

In the end, I can recommend the echo show to anyone looking for a smart speaker with a display, but is invested in the Amazon ecosystem. Amazon really needs to solve this feud with Google, it is a mistake to not have YouTube on this device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

YouTube is unusable.","December 25, 2018","The lack of customization of the home screen is seriously appalling.

The default time display is tiny. I can't read it from more than 5 feet away. And you can't configure the size!
The weather display is even smaller. Again can't change anything about that.
At most times, about 85% of the screen real estate is wasted.  But you can't configure it to be useful in any way.

Another oddity is that even if you enable stocks in the home screen, there is no way to add a stock ticker to it. All it does is show the DJIA. Gee, thanks! Useless!

The icing on the cake is that thanks to Amazon's feud with Google, YouTube is downright unusable on this device. There is no app. You have to access it through the browser which is extremely slow. It also makes you watch multiple ads before and in the middle of videos. Pointless.

If I can wait that long that is... because these are that much nicer looking and the video & sound quality are both a definite improvement.

I also much prefer the Echo Show over the Echo's without a screen.  I won't be buying audio only ever again.

Seemingly nice addition, but realized fairly quickly that the screen is really rather useless.  I ask it to search for recipe for dinner for instant pot...only searched one site...great (sigh).  Got more specific and asked for my favorite vegetarian chili mac recipe for instant pot...couldn't find it because it only searches one site (and nothing else).  Tried to watch some videos which wasn't very intuitive...also a fail.

I mean, it's a touch screen, so theoretically it's like a tablet, right?  Um...no.

If you just want visual output for Alexa, then this device is it.  If you want anything else, including something which can make managing your life or home easier, then you might consider the Google Home Hub or even a inexpensive tablet instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_51?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=51&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My brother had just gotten me an Echo Show so we returned the Google and got them a show instead.

The Good:
I will say this integrated much quicker than the Google Home since I'm a Prime User. Setup was extremely simple where as with Google I don't use it much more than for an old email account.

I really enjoy the screen. Calling up a News Flash, weather, shopping list and being able to see it was really nice. Screen is only 720p but honestly at this size you cannot tell.

Sound quality is pretty good. We've got an echo dot and you can absolutely tell the difference. We have an open floor plan downstairs and the sound travels well from the kitchen to the living room.

It works with my Nest products (google owned) with one or two minor issues I'll add in the Cons. But it can control my thermostats and pulls video from my doorbell camera.

Has a built in Smart HUB which is great. Makes pairing other smart devices extremely easy. Usually the echo show can detect automatically which is a plus and if it's another amazon product it's extremely easy.

Works extremely well with Amazon Music and Spotify.

It does have a working web browser and can connect to Youtube. It can also call up recipes easily.

Shopping list is fantastic and the phone app pairs nicely to it.

Bad or Could be Better:
It can connect and show video to my Nest Hello camera but no sound. Nest is Google owned so they don't always play nicely together. Not a huge deal though.

My other Nest complaint was the Nest Skills you must download on the show. I would select the Doorbell and it would take me to the security camera skill. I eventually learned through some message boards to just download the security camera skill and it should recognize it which it eventually did. Just took some time.

One noticeable difference is Google's AI is better. It understood me far more frequently and did not struggle with questions nearly as much. Alexa isn't bad, it just isn't as good.

Some setting features are in the Show and some are in the app you have to download. I found it a little clunky especially on the show side.

The whole skills thing so far seems lacking. It looked like a bunch of junk so far or that's at least the recommendations I keep getting. I'm more interested in productive integration...not jeopardy.

Video calling works. But the recipient has to have a Show or the app downloaded. Just like facetime on Apple, you can't use it on an Android. Most of us seem to have an iPhone so no big deal there, but this is a much smaller market at this point. I've heard skype is coming soon so that should help. I haven't done a Show to Show call yet so I cannot comment.

Not a big fan of how shopping on prime has been setup. It feels super limited so I'll stick to a computer for purchases.

Overall:
Really like this product. If you're a Prime user it's fantastic for music, video, shipping notifications and delivery. If not it might not be as great but it's still a smart speaker so it doesn't lose too many points. I think they could iron out a few issues regarding software design and making it more intuitive, and they could deff spend a few dollars getting Alexa to Goggle AI levels. I will say I'm still learning to full capabilities of this device so my opinions could greatly improve in the future as I learn more features and add my smart products to my home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Allows you to multitask by being able to look things up, listen to and change music, get the weather, etc., while you're busy doing something else. She is able to hear quite well from a reasonable distance, even when playing music and is hooked up to our Ring doorbell, letting us (and the kids) check who is at the door - with audio and video - without getting up. You must be aware that when asking Alexa questions, you have to phrase it just right or she may not understand, although I am impressed with the amount of commands/questions she can respond to.

In that time we have lost then gained youtube access, and gained Tidal and Hulu support, This device is wonderful as it s basically a tablet in a speaker enclosure so you get a full screen experience at the expense of front directed audio. Since I still feel they are targeting the this for a corner of your kitchen all of the sound is now reflected from the back and while it is much more ""spacious"" and ""immersive"", its not nearly as clear as front fired speakers, this is true with TVs, phones, tablets, laptops etc so its not a device specific behavior. This gen also has a built in Zigbee hub so you can use things like Hue bulbs without having to buy the additional hub. If you can grab one at a discount, its definitely worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A.  It seems to sense ambient light (or knows the time of day and operates from that) and adjusts the brightness.  The problem is that it is not bright enough in low light making it hard to see.  There should be a manual brightness adjustment available as well as an automatic mode.

B.  The clock is too small and impossible to read from a distance.  The digital clock should have a multiple size option from current size to full screen.  Also a twelve hour clock and an analog clock display would be nice.

In general, the Echo Show may have a number of display options, but I'm not sure they are really useful.  Why watch a movie on the 10"" screen when the big TV with better quality video and sound is nearby.  I do like the seven day weather display.  One of the nicest features (also available on all Echo devices) is the ""drop in"" and ""announce"" feature turning all the Echos into an intercom system throughout the house.

I’ve had the Echo Dots and I was happy with them but wasn’t sure if I needed a screen. Now that I have the Echo Show, I love the screen. I have it set up in the kitchen and can easily speak to it to search for recipes, control lights, play music and so forth. I shut off the camera for now because we’re not currently using it to do video chats. It sounds great playing music. With the Echo Dot, I would stream music via Bluetooth, but with the Echo Show it fills the room with a nice deep sound. I’m always looking for new things to do with the Echo Show and feel with the continuous skills updating, it will be even more useful in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_43?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=43&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Expensive ones. One for my wife and one for our best friends in Fl. The one in Fl appears to be ok (Have not had a video call yet)  but the one for my wife has issues. When she attempted to contact me it would dial our daughter (even though it has MY number listed) This has been partially fixed by customer service. Our contact lists do not fully show on the device. C/S currently trying to resolve. When making a call from the Echo Show it is supposed to default to making a video call. It did when it accidentally called our daughter but once they fixed that it no longer calls in video. Yet if the Show is called from our cell phones it answers in video. It's been almost 3 weeks and we're still dealing with technical assistance. I think they should either give us another unit or get this one properly operational. By the way, on 2 of the tech calls, the tech was unable to correct any of the issues and just disconnected the call! The current tech adviser is polite and trying to resolve the issues but we are losing patience. We also purchased a Ring Doorbell from Amazon to use in conjunction with the Echo Show but we won't attach it until the issues have been resolved. As far as using the other functions (like a Dot) they work fine.  We've always had a great experience with the Amazon service and I'd rather not have to have our credit card company cancel payment but this has gone on too long!

I think it is absolutely wonderful.  My original plan was to put it in the kitchen but in the end I swapped out the Echo in my bedroom and put the Show in there.  I find that the dimming function makes the display on the Show so soothing that sleeping in the same room is no problem.  The sound is great.  I replaced the background with a picture of my own choosing and I find at least some of the rolling screen suggestions worth taking.  If I need it in the kitchen, I can always pick it up and move it there.

So far, when I have tried to use it, it has been a letdown. The Alexa commands are not exhaustive/intuitive enough to navigate purely by voice, but there is also no effective way to navigate by touch. Asking Alexa to play a program that is available on Hulu sent me to Prime Video instead, where it showed a pay option. When I tried to display a recipe, it continued to time out between when I glanced at the screen, completed a step, and returned to see what was next. With egg- or floured-covered hands, it was an extremely frustrating process that led me to print the recipe anyway.

Beyond those experiences, my Echo Show has sat dormant, which is very unusual for a new toy. It does not seem to be worth the money, and I might be returning mine and returning to the radio and my cookbooks, which accomplish as much or more as this new piece of technology.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For music, yes, this is an excellent device.  The sound is loud, clear and surprisingly well-rounded.  Alexa recognizes voice commands very well in this respect.  Movies, on the other hand, are a struggle.  First, Alexa does not recognize most movie names by voice command, even ones I know are on Prime Video.  Next, if you have Alexa take you directly to Prime Video, it offers only a ""lite"" version of the service.  You cannot search movies well and the few categories they have stop at 60 results.  Being that I can easily stream 4-6 movies a day while working, I've already exhausted most of the good choices.  Then, for whatever reason, the audio volume on videos is 50-70% lower than music.  So in order to watch a video at arm's length away, I have to turn the volume to 1/2 at minimum, but usually 3/4.  I don't understand the massive disparity between music and movie volume.  Worse yet, if Alexa responds to a command while I'm watching a movie at that volume, her voice is two or three times louder than the movie, which is to say, obnoxiously loud.  Now, maybe I bought this for the wrong purpose.  I am never going to video call or have it control my lights, nor am I going to ask it to set an alarm or give me a recipe.  However, with the marketing claiming there are tens of thousands of commands, I was under the impression that doing something as simple as using Amazon's own video streaming service would be incredibly smooth.  Unfortunately it is not.  And like others have said, this is a touch screen after all, but there are very few things you can actually use it for.  I think I am used to the app screen on my phone I guess.  I keep expecting to be able to go to a home screen and pick what I want to do.  With no clear index of abilities, I really have no idea what I can do until I try things.  Then, after Alexa tells me she doesn't understand five or ten times, I just give up.  Last, I've gotten some errors while streaming video that claim the device's storage is full and it can no longer stream.  Well, there is no apparent way to clear the storage; streaming data should be temporarily stored and automatically replaced with new data anyway.  Because of this, I've had to restart the unit to clear the memory, which can only be done by unplugging it.  Yes, really, even with a touch screen and pull-down menu at the top, there's no restart button, you actually have to unplug it.  Decisions like these make me question who they had working on R&D.  Some of these things just don't make sense.  I do think this has the potential to be a 5-star device with the hardware as-is -- the screen is very nice and the speakers sound excellent except for the volume issue.  I know not to expect the functionality of a pad or phone with a mobile OS, but I also feel very limited by the intuitiveness and functionality of the system as it is today.  Unfortunately I doubt the fixes will come before my refund eligibility expires...","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Also with the use of some of the available apps and skills it can give you a TV where you didn't have one before. I used to not be able to see my TV while i was at the stove but now i can watch TV while I am Cooking.

When I saw it didn't allow Netflix, I wasn't sure but talked myself into it for the voice control and being able to stream HBO.  However, I can't watch HBO because I didn't purchase it through Amazon.

I love them both.  Upgrading to the 2nd generation was a no brainer with the larger screen and speaker.  However, the Show still has a ways to go before Amazon gets it right.

1. Yes, speaker is larger and more powerful but you lose the intended effect when the speaker points away from you.  The actual sound experience for someone standing in front of the Show is a disappointment and actually felt more like a downgrade.  Amazon needs to address the directional flow of sound better.  The round Echo's are great in terms of projecting sound throughout the room because of it's shape and position of speakers. . . obviously.  The Show is too directional and moving sound away from you is not an upgrade in my humble opinion.

2.  Tried the video call yesterday and I was shocked.  Streaming can be fairly choppy and reminiscent of some of the first web cams that came out onto the market.  Low resolution. . . Don't expect to see anywhere close to the same quality streaming as you will get watching something from the Amazon library.  Amazon dropped the ball on this one.

I was hoping to pick up additional units as gifts, but at this point, I'll wait until next year to see how Amazon improves upon this year's mode.  While I love the larger screen, I would not recommend an upgrade unless you really want the larger screen and don't mind turning the Show around to benefit from the larger speakers.

And finally. . . Amazon decided to take a picture of my package at the front door with a link that asks me how I feel about posting a picture online.  Seriously?  While the picture is only visible in my account, my first thought was that they're trying to move away from any culpability if thieves steal from your house.  I have an enclosed patio, out of site from the street.  What's to keep a dishonest delivery person from picking up the package after it's been documented online as delivered?  Not everyone may feel this way, but it felt like a violation of privacy and an effort which came across a little too aggressive and with no explanation.  If Amazon is that concerned, require a signature.  I'd rather pick it up at the post office the next day than to have a level of risk which clearly leans against the customer if delivery issues arise.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I'm just starting to use smart items in my home and this is so great. You can all kinds of different things with it, ask weather, recipes, and the one thing I really thought was great you can tell it to play your favorite radio station (example Alexa play 97.1 the river which is a station out of Atlanta Ga.) and it will play it without any static. And it sounds as good or better than your regular home stereo. You can set alarm to wake you. I could go on & on but I'm sure you get my point. It is TOTALLY worth it, and very easy to use. My 60 year old cousin can even use it and he doesn't even know how to use a smartphone. He lives with me and I catch him all the time asking it questions thought that's cool.

Well I’m supposed to fly to another state later this week to give to an elderly relative! And this would be a disaster if it was a Christmas present!! Well I’ve been on hold for almost 15 mins waiting for a rep I can understand.. my advise is DO NOT BUY!! They rushed the manufacturing and the support is horrendous!!

Update - This is still an ongoing NIGHTMARE!!! I finally got through to support after multiple calls and was promised a new device was being sent straight to FL where I was flying to do the install for elderly grandma with Alzheimers. I traveled yesterday to FL from NJ to install and the device they sent was an Echo Show 1 that was REFURBISHED and missing the charger!!!

Why??? I have to use a phone, tablet or a PC/Mac to access the Alexa app this device is supposed to portray.
-Alexa dim all lights 50%!!! ""Sorry all hue lights are not responding!"" (Lights are offline on the Alexa App but perfectly fine on the Philips Hue app)
-It is supposed to ""sync"" with my Philips Hue account and mirrors my HUB setup from the Philips Hue app but no! Instead of just 4 fully assigned lights, this thing discovered 4 extra factory-named lights duplicating the ones that were fully assigned. Delete the duplicates then all of a sudden ""Sorry Hue Lights are not responding"".
-Why is there no option to raise or lower Alexa voice directly like changing volumes for media, ringtone and notification like on any regular mobile device?
-Why is there no real settings to customize the Home Screen especially the CLOCK?
- Why under ""Lights and More"" you can only toggle on/off your lights. How about dimming and stuff?
- Most annoying if you're watching a video and say ""turn on/off lights...!"" You have to wait for it to execute the command then wait 15-20 secs before it resumes the video.

While there are a few major skills that are built in and seem to make use of the bare minimum (pause/back/forward with spotify is one example), why not extend the Echo ecosystem so that 3rd parties can put some basic apps into here if we add their skills?

Spotify should allow us to select playlists, radio, or artists from the echo touchscreen.

We should be able to use a basic web browser to find recipe's online instead of the terrible ""all-recipes"" app and search functionality.

We should be able to cast from our phone, or at least do something like ""pushbullet"" does, where we send a link to the show, and it loads it in the Show (I'm thinking for random web recipes, or youtube links, etc...

Without these basics, I don't see the appeal to the show right now - these are really bare minimum to me to make it useful. The Google Home Hub does a lot of this already as well from my experience with it.

The sound is quite decent, the form factor is good, the screen is nice, it's still an echo and has alexa. It's just not quite there yet, and I hope it improves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We also have the Google Home.  The Alexa has an amazing sound speaker, but be aware that you cannot play multiple songs on multiple devices without a $15 a month charge. This is very frustrating. I have a family of six, each person owning a dot and we have the show. The kids all want to set their own alarms and reminders and it is quite frustrating. This technology Seems like it is in its infancy, unfortunately.  Alexa get stumped very easily on questions, and you have to have just the right wording. However she does search for recipes and you can scroll through them and pick the one you want. That is helpful in the kitchen. It does have a large selection of music on Amazon music, however to get an unlimited amount, again, you have to pay for it. This is why we got the Google home as well, So we can get what we need without the hassle of trying to re-word every question we ask Alexa. That being said, the Google Home and the minis do not have good sound systems. They are decent, but Alexa blows them out of the water with her sound system.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For the first 3 months of using the Show, I did not use anything Zigbee-related, so it didn’t seem to be a benefit.  However, I’ve discovered some fantastic Sengled light bulbs which are Zigbee-certified and will connect directly with the Show.  What this means is I don’t need a separate hub, I don’t have to use up another electrical outlet, I don’t have to download another app, and I don’t have to download another Skill.  Everything is easily set up through the Alexa app — hallelujah!  So, though the Show still remains limited in many ways, being able to set up and control my new smart light bulbs is a new big plus to me.  I now have smart light bulbs and Amazon Smart Plugs all using only the Alexa app.

Updated 2/3/19:  I find this device to be disappointing for the price.  I’ve had the Show for two months now.  It has a few positives (nice display, decent sound, Zigbee controller) and others have commented on them.  I don’t use Zigbee devices, so that’s not a benefit to me.  However, what I noticed most are the negatives:

1. It can’t do 2 things at one time.  For instance, it’s not possible to watch the livestream of your baby sleeping and also play music or an audiobook.  It can do one or the other.  A Fire tablet can do both, though without the audio power of the Show.
2. It’s not possible to watch the map tracking of your delivery.  Perhaps it would require computer components to do that, but I find it annoying that it’s not possible on the Show.  It’s available on my Fire tablets or Shop Amazon app, and it would be nice to watch on the Show.
3. It has no light ring for notifications.  I’m surprised at how irritating I find this.  I can walk through a room that has an Echo or Dot in it and immediately see that there is something I should attend to.  Not so with the Show.  Only if I happen to be in the room at the time a message arrives will I be aware there is a message.
4. It doesn’t show the list of your skills.  Alexa will read them off instead.  This is way too slow.
5. It nicely plays Prime videos.  However, it’s like watching a 10 inch TV when I’ve got a huge big screen and Fire TV on the opposite wall.
6. It emits a lot of light, just like a TV, even at the lowest light level.  If I have the ambient clock on, there is way too much light emitted for a bedroom (unless you want a ten-inch bright nightlight).  I can turn off the clock which will allow the display to eventually go dark, but then I have no clock, although I can always ask Alexa the time.
7. It’s heavy and tethered to the electrical cord.  I like to move around my kitchen and sometimes move my recipes with me.  I can’t do that with the Show.  Plus, I can’t enlarge the font.
8.  I noticed that some of my Skills sometimes flash a message on the screen and by the time I get up close to read what it says, the message is gone.  Gone, as in no way to replay it (that I can find).

I love my Fire tablets, Echos, Dots, and Fire TVs.  I’m also liking my new Amazon Smart Plugs.  I also felt those devices were good values when on sale.  The Echo Show has me less enthused.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not impressed with the process to “repair” (found out only after I reached out to amazon it can’t be repaired and at that time, unable to be returned). So I was leery of the second gen but it’s much more refined - bigger and better screen, definite improvement in sound quality. Picks up my voice an easy 25’ away and is good for background music (for our use). Just beginning to “drop in” with other devices at home and with Contacts — easy and beautiful screen with no lag in video conferencing.

It's this bipolar extreme between good voice recognition and absolute horrific make you want to smash your head into a brick wall frustration.

The Echo Show for what it is supposed to be able to do is incredibly inadequate and this is something that I feel should be obvious. This is 2019. Not 1995. We live in a world where even crappy cell phones can go back to apps that were opened

ANYTHING that you're doing, is completely interrupted when you ask it something else, and then afterwards, there's absolutely NO WAY to get back to what you were doing without it starting over as if it totally quit the program AFTER you asked it to switch back to it.

For instance, there's a built in web browser (Just so you don't think this is skill-related and maybe Amazon pass the buck). Let's say I'm browsing a page.. Could be anything like. Any page. I then say ""What's the weather like?"" It takes me away from the page to show me the weather and say it also of course. At the end if I say ""resume firefox"" or whatever it literally will go to the OPENING of the browser as if I had NOTHING open.

Same with the Twitch skill. So I will say ""open <streamer>"" and it will open the stream. Cool. then I wanted to know the weather. Cool got the weather. But now Twitch isn't being shown, so I say ""resume Twitch"" ... it goes to the purple Twitch home screen ""X channels you follow are online. Would you like to see them?"" no. when I say resume Twitch I want you to !@&*(&#^&*^ resume what was playing before I asked what the weather was.

This is so basic functionality it's not even funny.

To continue the story, I then proceed to say ""Ask twitch for <streamer>"" TWENTY TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To which EVERY TIME Alexa says ""I dont' recognize that streamer name"" then other times it opens up Wikipedia to something completely unrelated that I DID NOT SAY. So I end up resorting to asking it to open Twitch and then tapping the options on screen as if I'm using a Tablet, completely defeating the purpose of a FREAKING VOICE ASSISTANT.

Now a more simpler thing. With Google Home you can say ""Turn on the energize"" and it knows it's in whatever room it's in so it will turn on the lights with that scene in that room. Or you can say ""Turn on the energize  everywhere"" and it will turn that scene on in every room in the house. OR you can say ""Turn on the energize in the dining room"" while in the bedroom.

Alexa? Not a chance. I mean yes. You set up rooms. Yes. You put Alexa in a certain room. No. She doesn't seem to know what room she's in nor can she turn on ANYTHING in that room without you being AS FULLY EXPLICIT.. ""Turn on the energize in the bedroom"" .. even though you're in the bedroom, because saying ""Turn on the energize"" is met with ""There are multiple devices with that name, can you tell me which one you want?"" then it's like defusing a bomb, because saying the natural response to that question ""<name of device>"" is met with ""I'm sorry. I didn't understand that.""

Basically you have to GIVE IT THE FULL COMMAND as if it has absolutely ZERO understanding of language or anything else. In other words it's primitive as a straw hut in the middle of the jungle.

Amazing idea, implemented boneheadedly awful. And sad to say this is why other devices are running circles around it. For all the features that Echo Show is supposed to have, it is ruined by it's complete incompetence at voice control.

And once you realize that you cannot even REMOTELY talk to it like you'd talk to something that even TRIES to mimick human conversation, it still won't understand you half the time, as evidence by me telling it to go to the streamer that I just said once and it understood and then it fails to understand twelve times and I have to actually just press buttons to get there because the voice command is garbage.

I pre-ordered the first Amazon Echo and still have it. The voice command has not improved AT ALL since then. Having a continue mode where it listens again for a follow up command is NOT better speech recognition. It's just code.

You need better AI, by like a billion lightyears of a long shot. If it didn't perform the basic functions of controlling the lights etc. with learnable , though less convenient commands, I would return it.

I don't even want to install additional skills on it because my experience using it to watch Twitch has probably taken ten years off my life. I'll just use the computer the old fashioned way because IT WORKS.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If I could I'd give it a 4.5 stars (4 stars for today, .5 stars because it has load of potential.

Display: Excellent. It's big and I felt it was going to be too awkward at first because of the size but once I started using it the size of the display (and the unit) were more spot on.

Interface: Good, customizable.  Scrolls information if you want and adjusts based on lighting and activity around it (i.e. turns off/dims when dark and not active). Can control quite a few things including lights from the interface and also does a great job with video and other media both with displays and control.  Alexa works well in displaying information in usable forms (lists, links, data, video clips, etc). While I can control lighting, I found Google Home hub has a better interface for controlling things; just easier to get to and very easy/quick to turn on and off things in the same room.  I have not used any of the video calling etc. but from what I've seen that's pretty solid.

Sound: This thing sound great.  Full sound.  Not going to replace any high end systems for music or movies but it's good.  I tend to use it for audiobooks when I'm doing work around the house moreso than anything else and it's great for that.

Amazon still hasn't integrated things like Ring into this as well as is should.  As a comparison, the Google Home Hub integrates excellent with Nest. Someone ring the nest doorbell and it immediately shows the camera, it very quick with accessing other cameras or the thermostat.  I think it will get there and when it does it potentially will be better as I think the hardware is better (faster, better display, etc).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Honestly, it knew which WiFi network to use and the password (assume Amazon has it stashed in the cloud somewhere under my name). So that was nice.

Watching Prime video works fairly well, but it can be hard to get exactly what  you want without interacting with the touch screen (or possibly the remote, haven't tried that for anything but volume). On some shows and movies, it insists on bringing up a list of episodes, which can be scrolled through by intoning ""next"" and ""previous"" over and over. Other content plays immediately, picking up wherever I left off.

Hooked up Hulu as well, and telling the thing to ""watch Seinfeld"" worked automatically, bypassing Amazon Video where I don't have the rights. It picked up where I last left off and was able to advance episodes with ""next episode"", but ""previous episode"" unceremoniously dumped me on a Hulu list. Saying ""next episode"" on last episode put on to another series that is apparently part of ""My Stuff"" on Hulu.

Added the Echo Recast for off-the-air, which also works fairly well, but oddly enough it tries to launch Hulu to watch CBS. That doesn't work as I don't have Hulu Live. Oddly, NBC loads right up and ABC presents a poser: use Recast or Hulu. Telling it ""1"" for Recast works, but it would be nice if it would remember such decisions (with an interface to reset defaults). Using the ""channel guide"" command shows all of the expected channels (including CBS), so it's a bit of a mystery as to why it thinks CBS is only available on Hulu.

As for YouTube, the first command I tried was ""watch cat videos"" to see how bad the YT experience would be (thanks to a feud between Google and Amazon). Should have realized that the command didn't invoke YT at all. Later on asking for YT content, I was asked to choose between Silk or Firefox browsers. Choosing the former allowed for using YT through the touch screen. Suspect content integration is non-existent, though it should be able to at least search. Haven't bothered as YT is mostly a waste of time anyway.

Interfaces with the usual Alexa suspects of shopping (of course), checking the calendar, managing lists, setting alarms and timers, listening to music (now with lyrics), reading Kindle books, etc. are enhanced considerably by the screen. Phone calls worked as expected with an added visual interface; same for home automation. However, it seems that most 3rd party skills do not take advantage of the screen.

Speaking of home automation, I don't see a visual interface for setting scenes, but suspect they will work through voice.

No sign of notifications. Every other Alexa device I have lights up and beeps to indicate a new message. Would seem like a no-brainer to put these on the screen. Or perhaps the rotating display on the home screen covers these sorts of missives (mostly shopping related).

Sound is great, video looks great as well (though 720p I think).

Certainly this is the best alarm clock ever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen quality is excellent and the sound is fantastic. While i love how the image quality looks and how the sound performs, it does have a few flaws.

There is no main screen where all of your apps will live, You will need to ask the Echo to open things up. For some reason when ever i ask to open spotify it asks me to set up a video provider on the alexa app.

The Hulu app is limited in what you can search or watch and its the same thing for prime video. It is almost impossible to get the echo show to open up the correct show when you ask her to. I have found i have to ask the echo to open something and then look for it manually.

It is pretty bulky and takes up a bit of space .

The alexa app itself is a little hard to figure out and has made me use a google home to control my home devices.

All in all its a good speaker and great for video chatting ( Once you can figure it out), but there are still a lot of things that are lacking that Amazon could improve.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_24?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We selected the Echo Show 2 because the reviews said the sound was superior to the comparable Google device and because the built-in camera allowed video conferencing - something we do regularly.  While the speakers and picture lived up to our expectations, the quality of Skype calls was poor.  And, my wife was never able to get it to connect properly to her calendar.

Most importantly, Alexa did not give correct responses to many simple questions, including follow up questions to the trending topics that were suggested that we ask Alexa. Just 2 examples of many, Alexa suggested we ask about: A rare chimera cardinal, but it was unable to respond correctly when we asked to see pictures. And, Usain Bolt beating the NFL 40-yard dash record, but it could not respond correctly when we asked what was the record time. Also, it was unable to respond correctly on multiple occasions when we wanted to see recipes for specific foods.

Every day we experienced numerous instances where Alexa could not provide an answer, but we were able to get the correct answer from the Google Assistant. (The requests for pictures was done with our smart phones but others were done with the Google Mini.) The inability to respond and/or the incorrect responses from the onset caused us to start testing and comparing Alexa versus the Google Assistant right away. After a week, we had enough and concluded that Alexa was unable to meet our needs.

Because of our extreme frustration with getting accurate information, we never bothered to connect Alexa to the other smart devices in our home, so we cannot say how Alexa might have handled tasks like turning lights on and off. And, I was not satisfied with the limited selection offered to shopping inquiries versus the selection offered when looking at Amazon on my computer.

While the reviews indicated that Alexa is compatible with more 3rd party devices, they also said that Google had the edge to answering informational inquiries. We just never imagined that the discrepancy would be so great. If getting answers to questions regarding news, sports or 'how to' are important, we suggest you go with the Google Assistant.

The final irony came as I prepared to return the product. Alexa was unable to respond to the question of how to reset the device to the factory defaults, but Google was able to give me the answer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(my attempt at humor) Seriously I have set it up with the smart plug and the security camera and enjoy listening to classical music.

The only way to see photographs clearly was to view it straight on.  Any movement to off-angle resulted in a washed out mess.  The second gen is only slightly better in that regard to the first gen. It still has an annoying wash-out appearance when viewed off angle, but the angle appears to be a bit wider.  This is likely due to the larger dimensions of the display, and not any change to the underlying display technology.  For the display tech nerds out there, this is very likely an edge-lit TN type LCD (ie the worst of the worst for image quality)  If you're expecting an IPS or OLED and would be disappointed with anything as low quality as a TN type then you might as well skip this device.  The sound quality, however, is much better in my opinion.  The base is deeper for sure.  Because of the improved sound alone I decided to overlook the screen deficiencies and keep it.  It still makes a good Echo device and the best alarm clock you could possibly purchase right now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_88?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=88&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love this product, and have talked my sister and my cousin into buying them for their children homes as a x-mas gift.  I think one bought 6 and the other bought 5!  They all love them!

Once the trust is broken you stop using it. You stop asking questions to Alexa, effectively disabling the point of owning the device.

I'm happy with the purchase because I was told the speaker system on this version was the best. It absolutely is. It is room filling, with tons of bass. It's quite amazing, really.

There's a few things like timers, and lists that work better with a visual display, but it feels like they haven't worked on Alexa's vocabulary or fields of understanding at all. She says she doesn't know to a LOT of things.

Hulu, does not work for me. I'm seeing a good mix of people who say it does and some saying it doesn't, but it will not connect to my login. It is also unstable at the login screen.
There's a 'screen captcha' anti-bot segment to the login.
I went through this thing 6 times.. At first it would barely load. It did seem to speed up, and I changed my login just to make sure I had a very simple one for the interface.
If you get through the captcha with the correct login and password, it tells you that 'Hulu is not available at this time. Try again later.'

I had a first attempt get stuck on this screen and not allow me to go back into the login section. I reset to factory defaults to get it back.

This device.. It feels like an early 2000's piece of tech. It doesn't have that apple slick feel to it where everything just works, and obviously they released it slightly unpolished.

I also can't get my nest thermostat to link.
There's a huge lack of slickness to the pairing of external devices and services that I find very disappointing. Considering how simplified and scaled down a device this is, what exactly is it if it can't operate external devices particularly well and doesn't do as much as a tablet?

We also own the 4K firetv cube, and the same problem happens. It wants you to be able to use it hands free, and encourages you to try, but because many of the things it wants you to do don't yet work well, (such as navigation and being stuck in netflix with no way to tell it to navigate towards the title called ""bah blah"", and having her tell you she doesn't know what the hell you mean), you realize immediately that it doesn't work well enough to let you do anything that the very first original echo could do, so, err.. Why does it exist?

For the cube, you immediately go back to the remote, and for the show, you realize that you just got an original echo with a screen, and you won't be using it for anything else.

For me, it's a decent bluetooth speaker that gives good weather reports.

I like the speaker.. I like all the original things I liked about the original echo, but the visualization and video apps are currently being wasted.
They would have been better off merging a full tablet with alexa, then at least you could navigate to and use hulu, and a web browser, etc etc while they catch up with her abilities.

I'll update my review if they update and fix some problems. I really see a future in this series, but they need to slow it down and get it working better before crossing a platform into visual with a format that can't take advantage of it yet.
It causes disappointment and brand wariness.

*update*
I attempted to login to hulu once again, and it simply worked right away.
No idea what the issue was, but there was no delay. Just straight in.
Also, I finally got my nest thermostat to pair. If I was of a suspicious mind, I would think it had something to do with my bad review that Amazon then contacted me over :D
Deals a deal though. I'll raise the stars to 3 and hope they will work on her abilities that she has right now, not continuously add trinkets to a half working idea.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I love that I can ""drop in"" automatically, without them having to get to the phone.  It works wonderfully.  All I say is ""Alexa, drop in on parents"" and walla!  It auto-answers on their end, and the video of their room goes opaque for about 10 seconds (for privacy purposes), and the Echo Show ""announces"" that I am calling them.  I can even mute the call (which also turns off my video), and still see/hear them (they can't see me when I'm muted, but they can see a small video image of their room in the top corner of the Show's screen, so they know they're still on video).  It sits on my desk, so when I'm in between calls/projects, I ""drop in"" on my parents several times a day.  Great for monitoring my parents (and their caregivers, who are pretty darn good).

You can also make 2-way video calls from the Alexa app on your phone.  Not as nice of an experience, but it's nice when you're away from your Echo.

The only thing I don't like/understand, is why it's mandatory to associate their contact with a phone number (video calls go over the internet, so they don't need a phone number).  I hope they fix this in the future.

To be honest, I haven't used the Echo Show for much else, except to play my favorite radio station, K-LOVE (positive, encouraging).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It took a while to figure out what Alexa understands, but eventually, we started to understand each other. I've got Ring cameras, and home security that communicate flawlessly. To be able to say ""Alexa, show me the garage"" (or front door) are nice features. Other smart home items I have integrated include a Honeywell thermostat, TP-Link light switches, and Meross outlet switches. All of them are working flawlessly. I occasionally ""drop in"" on my daughter and it's really nice to be able to have a video call with her. The video and audio are clear and easy to view and communicate. I also highly recommend the Echo Show (2nd generation) Adjustable Stand.

Bought a mix of echo dots and shows for the house this year for Christmas. Upon getting to know the system, i realized that you can only stream music on two devices at once. So I looked into it and you can create a household that lets 2 adults, 2 teens and 2 kids to stream music but this again will cost you 150 dollars a year to make that work. Also, i decided to move all of my photos and music to amazon so that it was all in one place. After a 40 minute phone call with customer service, i learned that you are now unable to upload any music bought on any other platform to amazon music. So I have amazon music unlimited but they are still asking me to pay for music that i have previously purchased. This is very upsetting. Also, supposedly you get unlimited photos being a prime member but as i was uploading my photos......all of a sudden i was told that i was out of space and had to pay more to store and backup my photos. My advice buy a google home or an apple product depending on where you store your music and videos.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you're trying to make it work for someone else in your Household, it's a nightmare.

I bought the new Echo Show for my daughter (who lives with her mom) so that we could video call.  We had previously made M an Amazon Teen account (CID-Teen), which gave her access to watch Prime video content, and shop as an Amazon prime member.  I am also a Prime Music Unlimited subscriber.  Amazon Music won't let her use her Teen account play music, so we had to create a new account just for that purpose (CID-Music).

The Alexa app would not let her Sign-In with her Teen Account. Then we tried removing her from the household (CID-Teen->CID-Normal).  She could then Sign-In to the Alexa app, but lost the ability to play videos, music, or shop as a prime member.

Then we tried to Sign-In with my account (CID-Parent), and add her as a comms profile (CID-Comms).  This initially failed because the mobile login claim (phone number) was associated with another CID.  We called support to get the number free'd up.  Once we were able to create the comms profile and Sign-In, we realized that this isn't a real solution either, as she now has all of the devices for my home (lights, tv's, etc) in her Alexa companion app, as opposed to just the Echo Show device that I bought for her.

4 calls to support, ~90 minutes wasted talking to CSAs.  No real solution available. Ugh.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(I’m actually scared to raise it to MAX because my neighbors would hear everything coming from it)
Display is really clear! And I love the simplicity it brings from understanding it to operating it!

I started with the “dot” expanding to the “plus” before landing on the first generation show.  I had purchased 4 shows, 4 dots, and a couple of the “plus” until I had an echo product in each room to control my homes lighting, temp, and security system. I tried out other products before settling down on the Amazon devices.  Now for the Show. I have added 2 of the Show 2 to my home. I absolutely love them. I have one beside my bed so at anytime I can check security cams throughout the house and talk to anyone who’s at the door. In add to an alarm, sleep aid with sleep sound skills, home intercom, speaker phone, I now have my own tv to catch up on prime movies or Hulu.

My personal opinion is simply this. Compare all you get in one device for the money. The new upgrades are amazing. The larger screen and speakers kick butt!  And the best part is the price remained the same!!!  If you haven’t, try it. I don’t see how you couldn’t be more than satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_32?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=32&reviewerType=all_reviews"

While I am no stranger to a computer, I will admit new technology isn't always easy for me to do by myself and when I had to go and select the newest Amazon Alexa app - well that's where I got stumped, have you seen all those apps. I simply asked my son, he sent me the link and wa-la all done.

This is a surprise gift for his Christmas. The show was packaged great, it felt like I was opening a new iPhone. The setup couldn't have been simpler, as I don't really like the Alexa app. Everything was done on the screen and there was no need for the app. I did mess up the setup by mistyping my phone number and that led me to call Amazon but they were able to fix that quickly. I was quite impressed with the overall build quality, the speakers were loud and it has decent bass. Also, the screen brightness automatically adjusts to fit surroundings, so when I wake up I am not blinded. I purchased this with the Wyze Cam $5 addon, and I will leave a review there for that.

Never recognize the smart products by name, not performing tasks like ""turn off room lights"" when multiple lights are there in a single. It just keeps asking which device or telling multiple devices found. Even after updating the address in alexa app and device it is not able to find the location for weather alerts etc. On the other side if i give the same commands to google no question is asked and job is done.

The screen is not only bigger but your wallpapers look more vivid especially pics with Autumn Leaves

Echo Show 2 is louder then Echo Show 1

You can access your smarthome controls in settings eg lights,switches,plugs etc.

You can ask Alexa to pull up firefox and silk browsers and you can view YouTube. I was able to view all my YouTube favorites,history,subscriptions etc once I logged in.

Music sounds more crisp on the Echo Show 2 especially Dolby

Show 2 has a lot of base but you can cut that down in the alexa app or in the settings as well I think.

I recommend the Echo Show Gen 2 and the Stand Accessory sold seperatly thru amazon.  The stand makes it look even better as you'll see in my picture.

An FYI Echo Show Gen 1 also now has the browsers,light controls,youtube etc since an Update. The advantage of the Echo Show 2 over the 1 is mainly the bigger screen size and it's HD Screen.

The Echo Show 1 is just a little brighter then the Echo Show 2 but the Show 2 looks better with your wallpaper pictures cause of the HD Screen. Show 1 isn't an HD Display.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For $400 I could get an iPad Mini and do 1000X more than this will do.  Not very customizable visually at all.  I can change the background and turn a few home screen options on or off.  Trending Topics is totally irrelevant to me.  I searched for ways to replace it with trending news stories from news sources that I like. So far there is no way to do this, even though this would be a very simple feature to add and would be much more useful than the trending topics.  Finding good skills (i.e. apps) is difficult.  For every 5 star skill available, there are fifty 1 star skills you have to look through.  I do like the suggestions that cycle at the bottom of the screen. Try “Alexa ...”.  This is actually useful along with the email they send you once a week with the same kind of tips.  Overall, the UI is extremely basic and boring though.  At this rate, you should wait for maybe the 5th generation if they are even still making these that long.  The 2nd generation is unimpressive and I honestly feel like I wasted my money.  Stick with the Echo Dot which is more reasonably priced.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
- Decent speakers

Cons:
Just about everything.
- It is heavy and oddly shaped
- Touchscreen is useless since you need to ask Alexa to do anything on the device
- Heavily reliant on the Alexa App configuration to do anything.
- On screen keyboard is split to the left and right of the screen. Placed a microphone icon in the middle to force you to talk to Alexa who doesn't understand you half the time. (Try entering a domain name in the web browser using Alexa, what laugh)
- No such thing as multitasking on this device.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_52?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=52&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We had to create an Amazon Account for Grand Pa in order to Import Contacts for Grand Pa because there is no other way to get contacts into the unit.

We do NOT want Grand Pa's Echo Show using our Primary Amazon Account nor have access to our Sensitive Contacts that other people visiting Grand Pa could access.

So we used a wiped un-activated spare phone and added Grand Pa's contacts there. Went to import Contacts into Alexa App which was logged into Grand Pa's Amazon account and it said you need to validate your phone number. So we had to validate it with my wife's phone. Bzzt that phone is locked to another account (the account we use for our Echo Show to talk to Grand Pa with).

We also wanted other relatives of Grand Pa to be ""dropped in on"" (which is the easiest way Grand Pa could contact someone) by Grand Pa. That requires every one have an Echo Show.

This is NOT for Grand Pa.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I understand that it’s not suppose to replace a tablet but it’s not user friendly. I wanted it for my kitchen to help me with recipes we all know how annoying your phone locking mid cook and having to unlock it to continue the recipe well if the recipe isn’t in Allrecipes and you open it in the browser when you walk away it closes the browser. If that’s not annoying enough when you tell Alexa to open up the browser again it doesn’t open the page you had so you have to search again. I did not realize you cannot do something as simple as Bluetooth to it which is disappointing for a 200$ Device, since I had the original audible I cannot even listen to books on it as my audible will not convert to Amazon.

Prest","Does Not Show Caller ID or Caller name on the Screen","November 30, 2018","If you hope to be able to visually monitor incoming telephone calls by using this in conjunction with an Echo Connect, forget about it. I have two Echo Show 2nd Generation units and two Echo Show 1st Generation units  and none of them show od say who is calling either with a name or a telephone number. All the screen shows and a voice says is ""Incoming Call"" with no visual or audio indication as to who is calling. Apparently, these features used to work but they no longer work. The Echo Connect is also supposed to announce the caller information on Echo units that don't have a screen, but that doesn't work either. For more information see the Amazon Forum about this issue. It looks like Amazon Tech Support ahs dropped the ball on getting this fixed. I just spent an hour on the phone with Amazon Tech Support and it looks like they haven't done much or anything to solve this problem

EDIT
the screen is literal trash, i watch movies on it from prime video and the backlight is so bad. From the Gen1 they made some progress with the screen-glass distance but in putting a larger screen they made it of poor quality. This screen would be fine for a $50 tablet but not for this price. i know Amazon can do better We have seen it on the more expensive tablets (still cost less than echo show gen 2). Also in putting a larger screen amazon forgot to upgrade the RAM, GPU and CPU as a result this model is slower then last year's. Amazon took 2 steps forward and 3 steps back

Edit
My unit was defective and all issues involving the screen have been fixed! That being said this is an excellent way to control smart home. Passive bass radiator makes all the difference!
I wouldn't go as far as to say that amazon hit a home run with this one but they are light years ahead of the market/competition with this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My major complaint is that the screen constantly tells you to try this, look at that, do this, do that.  It's so annoying and I've only had it for a day. I think you can turn the screen completely off but why should I have too.  Amazon needs to give it the flexibility to be customize-able and not just their way, stupid.  I personally think this will turn a lot of people off. Still undecided if I'm going to keep it.

Looked promising but the screen was a bit small for the price tag. Glad I waited for Gen 2! The screen on this thing is beautiful. Full HD and vibrant colors. I'm amazed that I can watch my Prime shows and it looks great. I also love the lyrics on the screen for Amazon Music. Sometimes I just want a solo karaoke session in my kitchen.
The sound of the Echo Show was what impressed me the most. I'm upgrading from a 1st Gen Echo Dot and the moment I heard the sound of the Show, I was blown away! There is so much bass and the volume can get insanely loud for such a little device. The kitchen might be my second most favorite spot in the house. Touchscreen is also very responsive and works great. The only thing I wish it had was an app hub so I can choose exactly what I want. Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand what I want to watch.

I love the  versatility of this device. I purchased 2, and sent one to one of our children who is grown and moved out. It definitely makes for better communication with them. The only 2 design flaws I have are: first, it doesn’t have an internal battery. So if I want to move it from the living room to the kitchen, to follow a recipe, I have to unplug and set the whole device up there. 2nd, it dosent come with an integrated stand that you can control the tilt or swivel with. I had to order a separate stand, I. Order to adjust the angle so the camera could see everyone in the living room. Other than that, I love it","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It feels half baked, mostly because the screen in not very functional or useful.
I think this will be great for my mom to be able to make video calls and I've decided to give one of mine to her. I'll keep the other one to talk back and keep it it in the bedroom or office to replace the alarm clock.

To make this better Amazon needs to make the screen more functional. Just give us a control panel with different screens. Let us put the home automation controls in there so that I can view (and change) the settings of all of the items in my smart home setup. THAT is what this should be. Actually I've been using one of my Echo Shows in the same room as my Fire TV Cube and that setup is almost impossible. I just wish this was functional with the voice control turned OFF  and that this and the Cube could work together rather than against each other as this would be a perfect control/info panel. It already has all of the hardware necessary to be that--but the software isn't there. Not even close to there in fact.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have the cloud cam in my nursery and use it as a baby monitor which works GREAT. I can view the camera on my phone, tablet, Fire tv (of which all our TVs primarily use) and now I can ask my new echo show to display the nursery as well which works great as a night stand monitor! Only problem is I also use Alexa to control various lights and switches throughout my house and when I ask my show to perform a smart home command like “turn off bedroom lights” when it’s time to go to sleep, it leaves my nursery cam then displays a control screen for whichever device or group the command was for. Which would be fine for a short while so long as it returned back to the nursery camera... it doesn’t... it displays the smart home control for a bit then goes to the home screen... forcing me to have to ask it to display the nursery again. This is very frustrating. As soon as this problem is fixed I will edit review to 5star.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was really reluctant to buying amazon products like the alexa smart speaker, and echo show because I didn't like the idea of some one or something listening to what I say at all times but I can honestly say I was wrong. I just got my echo show and smart speaker yesterday and I'm already in shock of how awesome these products are simple to set up and use and the quality of the sound amazes me my echo show is as loud as my 55'in LG 4K TV its an amazing smart little screen that does the job I can now clean ,cook and have dinner while watching my favorite shows without having to touch or press anything. Just with my voice I'm able to jump directly to whatever interest me.

Screen wise it is, speakers, there's too much base (there is an EQ, even with the base turned all the way down, still too much base).  The other issue is the speakers facing away from you, behind the device.  The first gen unit I could hear throughout my apartment at lower volumes, the second gen unit, I can't unless I really turn it up loud.  As I said my apartment, I use my Echo Show as an alarm clock, and listen to music while I wake up.  Getting back to the base issues, the last thing I figure my neighbors want to hear is the base coming from my Echo Show as base travels very well through walls.  So if you live in an apartment, and you wish to use this device as an alarm clock, I would advise finding a gen 1 Echo Show instead, as it's a much better choice, even with the smaller screen size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We have been surprised how much functionality it adds to the Echo experience. It is great to see your shopping list on the screen, it is helpful to see your audio books, nice to see the lyrics for music that is playing. Also, it works as a photo frame showing us the family pictures we uploaded. All in all, we are thrilled with it.

I added Amazon music unlimited, which allows you to ask it to play any song you want. And I cannot believe the sound quality! I was watching Amazon prime movies right off the bat. Beautiful bright screen no buffering. My wife took to it immediately and seems to love it. We will definitely be adding accessories to start building a “smart home”, light and thermostat control.

Hardware aesthetics are elegant, sound is great (Not as good as my true studio monitors, but this is for casual listening), and the screen is crisp. The automatic screen brightness and far-field microphones work flawlessly so far. Other reviews cover its qualities very well.

I have two gripes with the device, one software and one hardware. My software gripe is that there are few options to change the time, weather, and suggested phrases on the home screen. I expect this will be added functionality in a future update. (Amazon, I hope your SDE's are reading these!)

I'd like to have an invocation button on the device as the Echo/Dot/Plus do, but that's minor, and something I knew before purchasing the Show. My hardware gripe is with the rubber base. I was playing music with notable bass at 80% volume. The device continued to shake backwards, sliding away from me, until it almost FELL OFF my painted ledge. The rubber needs to be thicker to absorb the lower frequencies to mitigate this. I hope Amazon will offer a fix for this to keep devices from falling to the ground below.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_18?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=18&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Usability is subpar, many skills are gimmicks","January 26, 2019","I have five Echo's and smart home stuff all over the house. I use my Echos daily for alarms, changing the heat/AC, lights, timers, weather, news and podcasts and as an intercom. I was expecting to be pretty happy with the Show, but out of the box it has potential that has yet to be realized, at least from what I can tell. First, I thought video news would be great. Reuters was what I tried. It plays, but then I ask Alexa to exit. Instead of stopping, it simply shuts off the video, but the audio continues to play. Seriously, this is annoying. I tried a few recipe skills and they were quite clumsy, difficult to exit and one even wanted me to sign up online. Hello, I want to do everything on the Show, not go to some website. Why is this so complicated? The constant stream of various headlines and ""trending topics"" is annoying. Can I shut them off? I have yet to figure that out. So, with all the hype on developing a ""delightful user experience"" why do we have to start from zero with a new medium/platform? Why can't Amazon or Skill developers apply good UI design and make this not just easy to use, but fun? I'll add more later, but first impressions do matter. My new iPad, Kindle and other devices were a lot of fun right away. This should be too. Sadly the experience is more like buying a fussy new printer than an innovative new device. I am returning this. It is nothing but a machine to play dumb games on.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The idea of a screen to communicate is shrouded with incessant messages, haptic feedback, miserable intelligence and overall inconvenience. You will be much better off buying a cheap iPad and using the Echo Dot so you can at least move it.

Ideas to improve for the next generation:
-IMPROVE THE TOUCH SCREEN
The screen is so unresponsive, I'd love to give up on it entirely. I have to press ""buttons"" on the screen five or more times for it to register. While I'd love to alleviate these woes with voice commands, the device is severely impaired and has selective hearing. Often times my commands won't even have a single understood word. As much as I'd like to tell my Echo Show to ""stop giving me command options,"" it won't ""know that.""
-Display options
If I have to see one more ""Try, Alexa, tell me something weird"" prompt, I might throw up. You're a passive device, not my reluctant friend with ADD.
-Improved syncing:
While your speakers are marginally better than previous Echo devices, the connection between devices to have multi room music is awful. They are not in sync and it sounds collectively distorted and unpleasant to say the least.

Harris","Echo Show and Ring - Home Automation at it's best. Perfect for elderly parents.","January 14, 2019","I bought the Echo Show two-pack at a great price because I had recently purchased Ring doorbells for our house and our parents home. We wanted to be able to see who was at the door in either location before having to go answer the door because stairs in a split-level home are becoming more of a problem as they age.

I also wanted our parents to be able to see who was at the door without having to worry about constantly carrying a phone or finding it every time the doorbell rang. The Echo Show  just sits on the table near where they sit most of the time and a simple voice command can let them see and talk to whoever is there.

Although it kinda seems like 'spying,' it also gives us peace of mind to know that when our daughter is supposed to pick up Grandpa at 1:00p for his doctor appointment, she actually shows up on time. We have video evidence of the comings and goings at our parent's home.  And if she doesn't show, guess who is getting an emergency 'get your butt over there now'  call!

I work from home, so I placed the second unit in my upstairs office so I can do the same thing... see who it is and determine whether I have to drop everything to answer the door.  If a signature is required on a package, the carrier at least knows someone is on the way down, and I don't have to go to the post office to pick up 'missed deliveries.' This alone made it worth the cost of the Show in time saved going to the post office 2-3 times a month.

As an added benefit, my father-in-law likes to follow the markets, and Alexa can intermittently and automatically show him any stocks or market conditions he's interested in.

Echo Show makes caring for elderly parents so much easier and relieves a lot of worry about 'not knowing'.  We use the DROP IN feature to check in with them occasionally.  They do the same with us if they need anything. Any of the Echo/Alexa setups can do the same thing, but sometimes there is no substitute for being able to see the other person.

And finally, as one of many other added benefits, with Alexa no question goes unanswered, and with Amazon Music there isn't a song they can remember that they can't hear again on a moment's notice.  They often wonder who an actress is on an old movie and as long as you know the name of the movie you can get a list of cast members for pretty much anything.  And last Christmas we were over there and heard coming from the other room, ""Alexa, play Burl Ives Christmas music."" (Now there's something you don't hear every day....)  But by golly, Burl Ives Christmas music came up with lyrics, and the room was filled with ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" and a lot of other great old songs I'd never heard.  It made them very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_21?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I stick with my 2-star rating but this is relative to the 10"" Fire tablet and price. The Show 2 is not bad and I get it that there are niche uses.  Unfortunately, those niches are not for me. IMHO the Show should run Android and not this experimental and buggy funny interface. Even if I liked this funny interface, it is also available on the tablet. I like an Echo Dot with a screen (=Echo Spot). Amongst others I can travel with it and easily change the WiFi. Can I travel with the Show? Possibly but ...

It does, what it does and it is not bad except that the current software has issues. I cannot play Prime movies. Sound is worse than my $50 bluetooth soundbar. Screen is just 720p. Why, please why does this thing even exist? I mean, for that price Amazon could have taken the 10"" Amazon Fire tablet hardware and pug into the speakers of the Show. And please: what is Amazon thinking? Another proprietary power plug? How about USB C?

No, the Show is not bad. It just misses the point (for me).","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Deciding between Echo Show and Google Home is tough because most reviewers don’t own either. I finally decided on Echo Show because it controls more things, allows video chats, has a bigger screen, and gives me extras at no cost because of my Prime Membership (like Amazon Music).

Be aware that you need to decide which control convention to go with (Z-wave or Zigbee). I chose Zigbee because the switches and plugs that use Zigbee seemed to be a little cheaper than Z-wave devices. That means Echo’s higher cost can be offset by cheaper accessories. As you add more items, the difference adds up.

WiFi controlled devices will work with either Echo or Google but could begin to slow down your Internet due to traffic jams in your router. Z-wave and Zigbee apparently don’t go through the router.

Also be aware of the feud between Amazon and Google is kind of like between Sony’s Beta Max VCR and the VHS format. One will win and half of us will be left with outdated technology.

Smart ahome setup is beyond the capabilities of most home owners and you may need the help of a Tech Guru at additional cost. But if you just want to plug it in and surf while you cook, it’s not too hard to do.

Being able to check who’s at the front door, see when packages arrive, remotely control lights, are all easier for those with limited mobility, but they still need enough tech smarts to be able to make it work. Probably not a good option for a Grandparrent who doesn’t know how to use their smart phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I didn’t have this problem on the original Echo Show. The 2nd gen Echo Show screen is definitely larger and more vibrant.

Overall it’s not that useful unless you are going to watch something directly on it. It has Prime Video, Hulu and for some reason, NBC. Without Netflix, this makes it a light offering. The content (like news stories) it pushes out is rarely relevant to me. If you like following cooking recipes on tv, then this is probably good for the kitchen.

Alexa has all the same problems she has on every other Echo device, most frustratingly she can barely answer questions about what the device can do. Instead she either refers you to a help section that mysteriously isn’t available on the device itself even though it has a screen or she just says something like, “Hm, I don’t know that.” One improvement on Alexa’s shopping skills, particular to this device, is that you can look at the products, though it’s a narrow set.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I thought that the Echo Show would be a good replacement as we would also have Alexa skills available. Little did I know how hard it would be use this as a photo frame. I set a Prime Photos album as the background, but it doesn't rotate as an actual slideshow. I can ask Alexa to show an album, but it only displays all albums and I have to select the album I want. Then if we use Alexa, I have to go back to the photo album manually again. Using one of these to default to a digital photo frame seems like an obvious feature of something like this, but it fails completely at that. What use is an always on screen sitting in my house without being able to easily display photos?","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yowell","Not all that, Yet","December 16, 2018","I really like this device it resides in my Kitchen The Alexa functionality is good and getting better all the time. Sound and screen size is pleasing but like the rest of the device, it could use improvements. My two main complaints are #1 the is lack of multiple users control and #2 tablet type functionality.  If you want to make a call you can only pull from one address book which is cumbersome for a device meant to serve a home as a centralized device. The device is limited to the echo show mode and Aleza only and has no tablet-style functionality like adding your favorite apps which is limiting at best and a gross omission at the very least. I do hope the platform improves overall. Look at it this way if I want to add a new Hue or smart thing device I have to pick up my Fire HD 10 or phone or laptop to add it so Alexa can control it because the Echo Show is useless in this regard. Not what I expected and I'm sure very frustrating for many less tech-savvy DIYers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I just don't get the disparity between the marketing to skill set of the equipment - this product seems to be a donosaur pre-release of something that could be good that's coming in the future that we don't get to have or enjoy because we bought the lesser functioning version FIRST. NO HOME SCREEN TO CONTROL THE MACHINE & it's capabilities are non-existent to VERY DIFFICULT to harness or control in ANY way. I would not have bought this had I known. I would like Amazon to give us updates that improve this machine, like allow WEB SURFING & an actual home screen to control this machine. Even if I watch Days of Our Lives online episodes, all it allows is to go forward or backwards but not to control a 'refresh' option when Alexa Show goes frozen for hours during a commercial or show... this product I thought was going to be sci-fi-fun absolutely perfect advanced technology - this system IS SO LIMITED IT'S a NIGHTMARE to try to operate.  Voice commands are so minimal in scope and ability, I was shocked. What an overpriced product for just a wonderful speaker and a dinosauric operating screen even if it does have touch screen.  Like I said, you can't refresh anything, you can't ask it to find a business, or a local transportation website  which seem to show that it does not access the actual entire World Wide Web which is just loaded with useful information ti draw upon  - no web surfing at all through it. In other words, it can't even do what the web can and go to a place to get you the information it couldn't give you. It had a hard time finding my purchased amazon music, it can't go to a website, it can't play online episodes well of things: IT FREEZES and no refresh button, no controls, no voice capabilities with these things. Alexa show also asks you to link your home computer though vicky something when you try to get it to reach a website, then cannot link your computer when you follow the instructions for that - there's something wrong here - Amazon, where is the complete list of what this product even does other than weather or something very miniscule? I am shocked, I thought this would be sci-fi type fun it would be so advanced & am just shocked at how very little this Alexa Show can do. Positives are it does play really good radio stations and you can ask it to tell you how to say some common foreign language sentnces or words.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen display is also much better.  The sound quality is also great.  I'm glad I decided to purchase the newest version.

After reading some online reviews, I decided to update mine.  First, this isn't my first device. We have one in every room (echo, dot, show - 1st gen, & spot).  Second,  the more you use it,  the better the experience and the better it is for Alexa to understand what you want.  Third, once I figured out how to set up groups and connect all devices, the experience increased significantly.  I can play music in any combination of rooms in my home from my cell phone app.  It's been entertaining randomly starting funny songs on the bathroom dot when my unsuspecting husband is hanging out in there too long!  Fourth, I work from my home office and have my spot on the office desk.  Once I synced my calendar,  it was a game changer! I can see upcoming meetings from anywhere I have a screen or just ask the non-screen devices what's on my schedule.  I LOVE this feature!

Finally, having 3 adult children, I bought all of them a 1st gen show, now we can do video calls to each other from different sides of the country at any time since this works both on the screen device and on your cell phone.  This is wonderful and my favorite feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The video streaming commands are beyond frustrating.  I constantly have it not play things I'm requesting.  It won't pause by verbal command.  When you do pause it, if you have to do something longer than 2 minutes it closes the entire program and you have to find the episode you were watching again.  Alexa's voice is insanely loud and I can't adjust it... so after my son goes to bed I can't use it because it's so loud I don't want to wake him up since my office is right off his bedroom.  I constantly have issues with the touch screen not doing what I'm telling it to do (such as pressing play).  Disappointed to say the least since I love my Echo and thought by the second generation kinks like this would be worked out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But, after spending a few hours with it, I’m not that impressed. I’ll start off by saying the sound quality and output is amazing, other than that, I’m struggling to find a good use for it. I’ll give a full rundown below:

Backstory:

This is my first “screened” echo product. Originally, I was thinking this would have similar features to an android tablet. I wanted to use it in the kitchen and run some of my cooking/recipe “apps” on it. I somehow missed the memo that the Show is essentially an echo dot with a screen, and you can only choose from the limited “Amazon Skills” selection from the Alexa app using voice control. *In full disclosure and “TMI”, I’m on a strict low-carb/ sugar-free diet - the native recipe skill is almost useless for me...*

I know, I know, you can watch prime and other videos on it, but I have no idea why you would want to watch something on a 10” tabletop screen when your TV is 10x bigger, or on a tablet that's 50x thinner...

There is almost zero personalization available and everything seems to be locked down. Heck, I can’t even select items or information (like 5-day weather, news, calendar) to display on the home screen. Unless I’m missing something here, looks like the whole operating system literally just runs off the voice-controlled “skills”.

Out of curiosity, I went ahead and ordered the Fire HD 10” tablet with “Show Dock”, and I'm glad I did... With the Fire Tablet, I'm able to run the apps I like and it's completely mobile. I don't have the sound quality that the Show had, but this can easily be fixed with a nice Bluetooth speaker.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Took about 10 min to do updates and everything and since I already have a Alexa account for my other devices it was preregistered and automatically connected to internet.

The sound is amazing the attached video doesn’t do it justice. It has a pretty good sound wilder and IF you open a new card it’s 70 dollars off with a gift card so affectively after taxes I only paid 119 for it. You have to order by voice to get the early Black Friday price plus 10 dollars off first Alexa voice purchase then that’s how u get that 119 price line. Either way love it so far. Works perfectly with my nest camera. Takes no longer than the nest app to open up and show me on the screen.

Sound wise I’d say it could used some extra power in the mid range but still a very powerful speaker. That’s all based on the past hour playing with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It took 2 hours to set up just with passwords and accounts and all the other nonsense. Got the device for my mother to make calls. Then found out it can make calls out fine when it's paired with a smart phone BUT it doesn't allow calls IN unless it's from another echo device. Can't receive calls from other phones or mobile devices. WHAT A JOKE. PATHETIC. ALSO, when you're not using it, it shows ads. Really, really, really annoying. To buy a constant billboard of ads.

I don’t feel I got a major upgrade from just using the dots. Everything is meant to be done by voice control but honestly that isn’t always convenient. For example, we really wanted to use this for recipes. So I setup the push buttons for Firefox, then click on Pinterest, then find recipe, click on it to open full recipe. So far these are all pretty standard items. But the screen goes back to the home screen after so much time, haven’t found the setting to change this yet, and then you have to start ALL over. The webpage you were on is gone!  The show also doesn’t really act as a hub anymore than the app on my phone does for the Dots. I really don’t see the point of the show over an app and the dots.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_49?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=49&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you're decidedly on team Alexa, this smart display is the one for you. The second generation Echo Show is miles ahead of the original, but many of the first generation device's characteristics remain.  Four microphones on the front of the device and four on the top only slightly change the look of the controls. As for better hearing, Alexa heard me the first time with the new Echo Show at distances where I had to repeat the wake word three or four times on the first generation unit, Also The redesign brought much-needed change which makes me a lot more likely to want an Echo Show on display in my own home. the second generation Echo Show sounds much fuller, deeper and just plain better than both its predecessor and the Lenovo Smart Display. That's true for video chatting, online content and music streaming. Yes, a Google Home or HomePod will still win out for room-filling, quality sound. But for a smart display the new Echo Show is no slouch. Speaking of Fire TV, the Echo Show will integrate with Fire TV Recast to put live TV on the Echo Show as a recording .Fire TV Recast is a DVR setup for your smart display. Not everyone will value watching real TV on a smart display, but if nothing else, Amazon is taking the logical step of marrying its video services to its video-capable hardware.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_15?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Solberg","Nice product, but the interface isn't there quite yet.","October 17, 2018","This is nicely designed hardware. Pulling it out of the box, you get a sense that you're buying something of good quality. It has good, loud speakers, and a reasonably nice screen. I was pretty excited.

Unfortunately, the user interface let me down. I can feel the huge potential for this product, but every time I tried to do something, I was stymied in some way. It's not like it's a bad interface, it's more like it's not finished. For example, the home screen seems like it would be a great way to check on my day. I'd like to see a forecast for the today and maybe the next couple of days on the main screen. The other half of the screen could show maybe sports scores or news headlines, or maybe the status of all the connected lights in the house, or maybe a touch screen of quick actions to jump to recently used stuff.

None of that is available. You can get a rotating view of news headlines, but you can't pick your source. You can see sports information, but for some reason it only shows my local football team, and there's no way to choose. This would be a perfect heads up display, but the rotation of elements means that you'll have to stare at the screen for a long time before what you need pops up. Again, lots of potential, but not there yet.

Another thing to do with this is watch videos in the kitchen when you're cooking. This works okay, but everything about choosing and finding episodes in clunky and unfinished. For example, I wanted to watch the next show in the series I was watching, but for some reason, it went to the first episode. I could not see any way to go to the episodes list so I could choose the next episode, and I didn't know the correct number, so I couldn't try asking Alexa.

I thought about keeping it because if Amazon keeps iterating on the UI, someday it could be quite useful. However, at this point, it's well-designed hardware with software that frustratingly just wouldn't do what I wanted. I also considered keeping it because it works with the Fire TV Recast, but in the end, the hard to use interface was just a little too much to overcome, at least for now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The device is great looking and sounds pretty good.
HOWEVER, that is where everything stops.
The user interface for Alexa and Echo is absolutely garbage.
I tried to find another word to not be too crude, but, I couldn't.
Amazon, I'm sorry. I'm a huge fan of your great customer service and products.
Why did you design such a useless device from the ground up?
Say you want to play some songs on your pandora, well you will need to use at least 2 devices. You have to configure the station on a computer after going into 10 subselections (really well hidden). Then start pandora with a voice command on your Echo show. That absolutely defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker with a user interface.
Amazon, please allow people to use the screen on the echo show to configure apps, otherwise you sold a very good looking paper weight.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_44?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=44&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
-Good speaker
-Microphone can pick up my voice really well (better than the dots)
-Screen can be nice for video chat

Cons:
-Speaker evoremphasizes the bass (though the bass is adjustable)
-Screen never shuts off (I wish there was a power-save mode for when I am not using it)
-I rarely use the screen, I feel like it is a bit of a niche thing right now

 As it stands I like it.

I replaced all 4 of my 1st generation Echo Shows with 2nd generation Echo Shows and repurposed the older ones.

The screen is a big improvement on the 2nd Gen, you can really notice the size difference and the new screen looks a lot clearer. We use this for streaming cameras too and as a baby monitor and night and you can see all the detail you need to see.

The sound is improved as well. I listen to Pandora pretty much all day long on the Show in my office and for the size and footprint of it the sound quality is great. I will say the one thing I noticed, as far as audio goes, when you ask Alexa to turn up/down the volume vs. using the button the voice command jumps what seems to be a couple steps and I find myself having to go over and turn it down manually if it has gotten too loud. I get around this gernally by saying a specific level i.e. “Alexa, set the volume to 4”.

Overall I’m very happy I upgraded to the 2nd generation Echo Shows!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This thing has great potential, but it sorely needs a software update. If you think about it, it really does not do anything useful. Most of the time it just sits there. You need to be able to customize the home screen background and size of the time / weather. It could be a fantastic, basic, smart home controller, but it fails on that part. You need to be able to map addresses. You need an option to not show this ""Try"" nonsense at the bottom of the screen - that is just veiled advertising. It needs more thought put into accessibility features. I just tried: ""Alexa, show me the nearest pizza places"" as prompted by one of their ""Try …"" suggestions. It showed me 8 sample pizza offerings from different places, but did not state the distance. I tapped on one of the pizza offerings, it showed the distance, but would not let me map the location. If I want to order a pizza I would have to go to my computer – why bother with the Show?

This product has so much potential, but the implementation is garbage. It should never have been released for sale. The reality is it's just a tabletop dust collector – it does nothing. Most of the time it just sits there. It would be useful if it showed the time, day, and date on the home screen. It does show the time, but the font is too small to be useful and it's not configurable. It doesn't show the day or date. It shows an icon with the current weather and temperature, but again it's too small to see across a normal-size room and it's not configurable. 90% of the screen real estate is wasted. At the bottom they have an advertisement for ""Try: Alexa…"" And this can't be removed. After the first 15 minutes of ""Wow"", this gets old really fast.

The bottom line, in its present state I definitely could not recommend it to someone. If they fixed the software with some of the many complaints you see on the Echo Devices forum, it could be really good and useful.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Less than a month in and it's malfunctioning.  Way way over priced for what you get.  Should have stuck with my echo....which by the way...is also malfunctioning.

A little pricey considering it doesn't do much.  The touch screen doesn't have many options at all.  Most programming needs to be done with your phone.  Great sound.  Nice, heavy and sturdy so that it can't get knocked over easily.  Works good with my security system...however wish that the live camera feed would automatically show when it detects movements.  A split screen on my security cameras would be nice too.  I don't like amazon music as much as my other music app.  Some of the music titles they play in their stations aren't the #1 hits I want to listen to....some aren't desirable at all.

Bass is fluttery, grumbling at medium volume. Far from ""Premium Sound"". Video is excellent. Notations starting with ""Try''.... are in such small print that you need to be sitting within arms reach to read easily. Backgrounds are nice but boring, especially the predominate color... pea green and faded blue. The background paintings/drawings are generally uninteresting. There is no indoor temperature sensor.  There is a way to disable/enable the camera without disabling Alexa's monitoring ability.... just ask. ""Alexa"" could be way more intuitive and flexible in her understanding of questions and not require rote regurgitation of question formulation on subsequent questioning or requests. There must be some way that we humans can be relieved from Alexa's demand of complete and accurate remembrance/recollection of original task setup terminology for the myriad of tasks/requests we develop over time. We are not all ""Watsons"" but simple Earthlings. That's my review (so far) and I'm sticking to it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

My dad is not able to help me with things like that.  He has dementia and has trouble walking.  I am his daughter, but live six hours away from his nursing home.  We used to talk on the phone all the time, but now he has trouble answering his cell phone and indeed yesterday left it in his pants, washed it and the cell phone died.  I could not talk to him as I wanted. He was not able to answer video calls via Alexa without me reminding him on his cell to push the answer button.  But now, Thanks to the Drop-In feature I can just video call him anytime without him having to answer and the nurses have left a note telling him what to say so he can drop in on me and his two beautiful granddaughters when he wants.  Now, we spend hours together.  It is nothing short of a miracle to see his and my face and his granddaughters faces light up as he is able to interact with my family EVERY  SINGLE  DAY. You have brought our lives JOY and i cannot thank you enough for this innovative technology and the ease with which to operate it.

Was very excited about placing device in kitchen to watch YouTube.  Unfortunately, YouTube videos stop playing after 5 minutes and return to home page screen making it useless for this purpose.  Other web videos have trouble playing as well.  Video starts and after about 5 seconds starts over in endless loop.  I wouldn't recommend this product until they fix the video play problems.

Update #1 (1/4/19): Was contacted by Customer Service and was advised to unplug Echo Show for approximately 1 minute and then plug in again.  This action seemed to have fixed the problem as videos on YouTube and other Websites now play properly.  Therefore, I am revising my Overall Rating from a 1 to a 5.

Update #2 (1/5/19):  All problems came back when tried to play videos again.  In addition, screen became locked on video page with no way to exit.  Alexa commands didn't work.  Contacted customer service and Echo Show was factory reset.  Videos still didn't play properly.  Will probably try to return device.  Too bad.  Great idea for product, if it worked.

I have had to do numerous factory resets!","November 2, 2018","I have had to reset this device almost every time I play my Pandora stations. I will say ""Alexa stop"", no luck, ""Alexa off"", again no luck. Occasionally it will appear to stop playing Pandora music but when I come back later and ask to play again I am told Pandora is already playing, but there is no music playing.

Added the Echo Sub and that was another layer of fun. It works when it wants to. Most of the time I end up having to delete the pairing and go through the painful steps of creating a new sub pair, then repeat it sometimes the same day, others a day or two later.

Amazon released these devices way before they were ready for prime time! I have to admit the sound is great when they are working together but the time I spent making them work is really worth the sound quality improvements.

Hopefully Amazon is working on some software updates that make this product pair a much more enjoyable experience.

Until there is some improvements in both products software I can't recommend either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Flanagan","Waiting for updates","January 12, 2019","I have had multiple Echo devices, including the first generation Show. This is definitely an improvement on that, bigger screen, better music and sound, and video. However, more than any other single function, we use it as a digital picture frame. The background picture, when the device isn't being used for something else, can be set to an album that you have created on Amazon Photos. We loaded 400 or so photos, and they change at about one minute, which I think is a perfect time.

There are a couple of problems, though. First, the units have a tendency to stop and stay at one picture, until the unit is unplugged and plugged in again. This has been mentioned time and time again in reviews, but the Amazon team on this project has apparently either not prioritize it, or can't fix it. Expect this to continue until they make it a priority.

The second issue with this as a digital picture frame is that there's no customization, other than selecting the album. Pictures rotate chronologically, either by date taken or date uploaded. You cannot shuffle or randomize. So if you took a bunch of photos at a birthday party or wedding, you are going to see all of those pictures in succession, before it moves on to another. It's gotten to the point where I can predict what the next pictures going to be.

Also in the category of lack of customization – there is no effects that you can use with these pictures. There is no transition choice – fade,, wipe, side – nor were there any effects that can be used (Ken Burns, etc.) Amazon doesn't give you any kind of slideshow maker, and it doesn't support any third-party apps.

In the general category of Alexa – the skills have now become like Apple's app store. You can't find anything useful unless you read something about it somewhere. It suggests skills, based on one's you have already enabled. We tried that once. ""Big sky"" is a weather app that's pretty good. Around Christmas time, it was suggested that if we like that, we would like something called ""Sky Weather"". So I enabled it by voice. And then opened it. It went on for about two minutes. And Alexa did not appear to hear me calling for it to stop, so I had to scream. No more suggestions.

My home isn't smart enabled, so I'm not going to comment on its usefulness on that front. The recipes are definitely helpful, but I don't think I'll be watching much video on it. Simply finding your Amazon purchases can take time, and there's only a limited number of them that show. Finally, the ""drop in"". Nice idea, but these are usually going to be sitting on kitchen counters or side tables. You're going to have to squat down. In an age where everybody has an iPhone or iPad and Facetime is available, it's an inferior redundancy. (Oh, and it can be really annoying. I gave these to 2 sisters and a niece at Christmas. One of the sisters sent me a message. Suddenly, the Echo Dot next to my head started glowing and fading, glowing and fading. I couldn't figure out what the hell it was. So I could sleep, I just unplugged it. Next day, I saw other Dots glowing and fading, and went into the Show to find out what the heck was going on. Apparently it was the message, and it doesn't stop until you read it. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to texting.

They still haven't found the homerun app for this device. For us right now, it's pretty much a $229 picture frame that doesn't do everything we would like it to do.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There is an Amazon-produced youtube video that is worth watching.  However
it isn't in the Amazon help, and it isn't referenced by any of the Amazon help.
It gives some of the basics of the device.  I found it on google.
You can find it by searching for ""Echo Show Basics"" and it is about 3.5 minutes long.
If you watch the video, the device will be less infuriating and can easily be made
less presumptive.

In the book ""1984"" there was a telescreen.  It was always listening.  Always watching.
I always wondered how these devices might come into existence and into peoples homes.
I think that I just bought one.  Maybe I'm just afraid that I just bought one.

BTW, I do have an Echo, and I like it.
The Show, however, is another story.

The default mode is for it to be constantly doing something on the screen,
switching between ""cards"" which present separate types of information.
I spent most of today searching for or figuring out how to turn things off.

The home card/screen starts out with lots of stuff turned on. (That is the presumptive part.)
Trending topics, sports scores, upcoming events, Discovery with Alexa are all on, but you
can turn them off.
The one thing you cannot turn off is the Try ""Alexa, ..."" hint at the bottom of the screen
I searched for hours on how to turn this off.  It even displays when you are listening to music.
(This is what ""infuriating"" is referring to in the title!)

The default mode when playing songs is to show the lyrics.  There doesn't seem to be
a setting in the any of the various settings options to change this.  However, if you tap
the progress bar for a song while it is playing, it will bring up controls.  There is a ""Lyrics""
button.  I'm sure I just dense, but it took me a while to find this.

I also feel much more paranoid about the camera than I thought I would, even with it disabled.
I am not very happy with the device and wish that I never bought it.  Hopefully, it will improve over time.
I understand that some competitive devices have a shutter.

Some things I do like:
The multiple timer screen is pretty nice.  But, if you set a timer on one device, the other device doesn't know about it.
Sound is pretty good.  Another reviewer mentioned that the movie volume is noticeably less than the music or Alexa volume.  I also found this to be true.
The display is good.

Some things it doesn't suggest, but should:
""Alexa, go home""
""Alexa, go to settings""
""Alexa, turn off screen""
""Alexa, stop streaming""  This will cause it to release the stream so that another device can stream something.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Having now got it, i must admit that its a must have at every home. Compared to the Show 1, the screen size is a big improvement while HD quality display makes watching the Show 2 a pleasing experience.
The sound quality is far improved with an in-depth Base sound on the new Echo show. The touch panel is also more sensitive and responds to even a slight nudge.
I received the Echo Show 2 with a one months Hulu Subscription. Now that's what i call music! This Echo Show plays all our favourite Live TV channels (CNN, Fox, Cozy, Boomerang for kids .......) available on Hulu. This is indeed a new chapter in Television entertainment. In addition, Echo Show now has apps that can also play back some free to air Live News and entertainment channels.
I have so far no negative feedback on the product. I did however noticed that once connected to a Bluetooth speaker (in my case to a Yamaha bluetooth), there was a little lagging in the sound track. This is not the case with Echo Show 1. Maybe at the next software update, Amazon can fix this minor concern.
As always, A great product from Amazon. Try it Guys - it's sure worth the price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

BLACK","Lacking features that Generation 1 has","January 2, 2019","The only noticeable Improvement what's the largest screen. I've noticed no improvement in voice recognition compared to the Echo gen 1, Echo spot and Echo Show. The different LED lights that indicate whether you have an alert , message, delivery or any of the other statuses have been removed. There is no visual indication that triggers you to check the device if you're not next to it anymore. If you happen to be next to the device and the notification appears it disappears within four seconds so you barely have any time to read it. When a reminder appears on the screen it's always shows the current time at that moment that you are looking at the screen. it's very confusing if you look at the screen after the time that a reminder first appears because the screen always shows the current time next to the reminder instead of the time reminder was due. You can't tell how many minutes have passed just a reminder became due. I definitely prefer the Generation 1.

My wife calls and receives calls from all her friends and family from any room in the house.  Even in the back yard.  She plays music and controls all the lights as well with the Kasa devices.

Makes using recipes from web difficult","February 12, 2019","First, the Echo Show has a very nice display and the sound is fantastic! But the display sleeps too fast and there is no way to change it yet. I bought this device after seeing the ads and the pictures in the product description that show people using it in the kitchen.  My wife and I have a lot of recipes in Pinterest.  The display will go to the home screen if it not touched every few minutes. This is not ideal for cooking or baking. There is no way to adjust the screen sleep time apparently. I contacted customer service and tech support and was informed that it's not possible to do at this time. The Echo Show will probably be returned and we will go back to using our laptop in the kitchen.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The sound quality on this Echo Show is definitely better than the first generation.  The screen is bolder as well.  I own a first generation Echo Show as well... I do not love the new software update that hit all Echo Shows.  For example, if I set my background to show my family photos from Amazon Photos, I do not want to see stock photos of news stories as well!  I know I can turn off updates in my settings... BUT I like the words from the updates, I just want them over my photos like the old Echo software!  As it stands now, a family picture will come up, then a news story photo.  This is quite annoying!

I do not know how long Amazon will rule this market.  The new Google Hub looks like a great device.  However, the inferior sound and lack of a camera still puts it behind the Echo Show.  But in a couple years if a Google Hub Max comes out... I may switch to that!  The Google brain just is outpacing what Amazon’s articfical intelligence can do. (I have both Echos, Echo Shows, and Google Home’s in my house!)  Facebook also just released an interesting device similar to the Echo Show that lets you video message FaceTime Messenger contacts.  But as of 2018-2019, in my opinion, this is the best device of its kind on the market!  I’m very happy with this Echo Show compared to the first generation Echo Show!!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

So expensive yet not good at all! Was so looking forward to it and it failed. Contacted product support through chat and was offered a ""FREE"" replacement, which is insulting. There is nothing free about replacing an expensive defective product. I should have gone with Google Pod Assistant.

The new model is so much larger and better sounding; so much better for updated 2019 video-watching and video-calling experiences. plus the old one seems so tiny now (something maybe for a closet or other tiny room). Plus my perfect place is the high kitchen counter, and the new tilt-down base makes it useful even when sitting on the lower chairs in the breakfast room. Plus... yesterday I had asked Alexa on my old Echo Show if she wanted to be my Valentine and, the gall: she said ""no"", because she already had ""a strong connection to my WiFi"". That was the last straw. Out with the old; in with the new.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

One for me and my mom. She leaves in Texas and I in Kansas. The video and voice quality is outstanding when making a call. Really makes the distance apart seem less. I also use it with my security cameras. That’s another reason to buy even if you don’t know anyone who owns the Show or a Spot. The other features found on the Echo and Dot are icing on the cake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-2nd-Gen/product-reviews/B077SXWSRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_53?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=53&reviewerType=all_reviews"
